      "Validation (CV) and patients were stratified in low/high risk of LR. Models’ performance was evaluated through\n",

       "{'thoughts': \"Okay, so I'm trying to understand this article about using dosiomics to predict treatment outcomes for skull base chordomas treated with CIRT. Let me break it down step by step. First, the article mentions something called LETd, which stands for Linear Energy Transfer dose maps. They're comparing these to physical and RBE-weighted dose maps. I think RBE is Relative Biological Effectiveness, right? So they're looking at different ways of measuring radiation doses in the context of CIRT, which is Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy. That makes sense because proton therapy uses protons, but carbon ions are heavier particles, so their effects might be different and more complex to model. The article talks about predicting local recurrence (LR) versus local control (LC). So they're trying to see if certain dose metrics can predict whether the tumor will come back or not after treatment. They used something called a time-dependent ROC analysis for each feature. I remember ROC curves are Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, which show how well a binary classifier works. The area under the curve (AUC) tells you how good the model is at distinguishing between classes. A higher AUC means better performance. So they're looking at how well each dose metric can predict LR over time. They found that LETd had the highest AUC, which was 0.82, and it was statistically significant. That's pretty high; I think anything above 0.7 is considered good. The physical dose had an AUC of 0.69, which is still decent but not as good as LETd. RBE-weighted doses didn't perform as well either. This suggests that LETd might be a better predictor for treatment outcomes in this specific context. They also mention something about the shape of the tumor, specifically elongation, being an important factor. So even after accounting for dose metrics, how stretched out or elongated the tumor is still plays a role in predicting recurrence. That makes sense because tumor geometry can affect how radiation doses are distributed and absorbed. The article then goes on to talk about building TCP models, which I think stands for Tumor Control Probability. They used logistic regression with different features like LETd, physical dose, RBE-weighted dose, and clinical factors such as the volume of the gross tumor volume (GTV), elongation, sex, and involvement of organs at risk (OARs). The model using LETd had a higher AUC compared to models using just physical or RBE doses. This reinforces that LETd is a more effective metric for predicting treatment outcomes in this scenario. They also mention that the coefficients for texture features were relatively high in both D RBE and D PHYS, but mean absolute deviation was more important for LETd. I'm not entirely sure what all these terms mean, but it seems like they're looking at different aspects of how the dose is distributed within the tumor. Shape elongation was a significant factor across all models, which ties back to the earlier point about tumor geometry influencing outcomes. The authors acknowledge some limitations, mainly the small dataset due to the rarity of SBC and the long follow-up time needed because these tumors grow slowly. They suggest that future studies should include larger datasets and possibly combine features from different dose metrics with clinical parameters for better predictions. They also mention exploring more complex models like SVM or deep learning approaches to capture more intricate relationships in the data. Overall, this study seems to highlight the potential of LETd as a valuable tool in predicting treatment outcomes for SBC patients undergoing CIRT. It provides a foundation for further research and could lead to more personalized treatment plans by integrating dosiomic metrics with clinical factors.\",\n",
