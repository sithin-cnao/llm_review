Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from ""always-on"" signals, which complicate organ-specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH-responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH-sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal-to-noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual-function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH-switchable enzyme-like catalysis with dual-key co-activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe-related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.        This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment-adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non-specific liver uptake. image",0,,The article focuses on developing a responsive MPI tracer for improved imaging and adaptive therapy but does not mention AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

This study explores the efficacy of Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT) as a novel therapeutic approach for keloids, focusing on its impact on fibroblast proliferation, apoptosis induction, immunogenic cell death (ICD), macrophage polarization, and the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway. Utilizing a murine model of keloid formed by subcutaneous injection of zeocin in C57BL/6 mice, we demonstrated that CIRT effectively reduces collagenous fiber synthesis and collagen production in keloid tissues. Further, CIRT was shown to inhibit keloid fibroblast proliferation and to induce apoptosis, as evidenced by increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins and confirmed through flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Notably, CIRT induced mitochondrial stress, leading to enhanced immunogenicity of cell death, characterized by increased expression of ICD markers and secretion of interferon-y. Additionally, CIRT promoted a shift from M2 to M1 macrophage polarization, potentially reducing TGF-beta release and mitigating ECM deposition. Our findings suggest that CIRT mediates its therapeutic effects through the inhibition of the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway, thereby attenuating ECM formation and offering a promising avenue for keloid treatment. This study underscores the potential of CIRT as an innovative strategy for managing keloids, highlighting its multifaceted impact on key cellular processes involved in keloid pathogenesis.",0,[],The study does not explore any AI methods; it focuses solely on biological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of CIRT in keloids.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

They used various assays to measure these effects but there's no mention of AI methods or applications anywhere in the abstract. The focus is purely on biological mechanisms and therapeutic efficacy without any computational or AI techniques involved.

rayyan-97865224,"Particle tracking, recognition and LET evaluation of out-of-field proton therapy delivered to a phantom with implants","Objective. This study aims to assess the composition of scattered particles generated in proton therapy for tumors situated proximal to some titanium (Ti) dental implants. The investigation involves decomposing the mixed field and recording Linear Energy Transfer (LET) spectra to quantify the influence of metallic dental inserts located behind the tumor. Approach. A therapeutic conformal proton beam was used to deliver the treatment plan to an anthropomorphic head phantom with two types of implants inserted in the target volume (made of Ti and plastic, respectively). The scattered radiation resulted during the irradiation was detected by a hybrid semiconductor pixel detector MiniPIX Timepix3 that was placed distal to the Spread-out Bragg peak. Visualization and field decomposition of stray radiation were generated using algorithms trained in particle recognition based on artificial intelligence neural networks (AI NN). Spectral sensitive aspects of the scattered radiation were collected using two angular positions of the detector relative to the beam direction: 0 degrees and 60 degrees. Results. Using AI NN, 3 classes of particles were identified: protons, electrons & photons, and ions & fast neutrons. Placing a Ti implant in the beam's path resulted in predominantly electrons and photons, contributing 52.2% of the total number of detected particles, whereas for plastic implants, the contribution was 65.4%. Scattered protons comprised 45.5% and 31.9% with and without metal inserts, respectively. The LET spectra were derived for each group of particles identified, with values ranging from 0.01 to 7.5 keV mu m-1 for Ti implants/plastic implants. The low-LET component was primarily composed of electrons and photons, while the high-LET component corresponded to protons and ions. Significance. This method, complemented by directional maps, holds the potential for evaluating and validating treatment plans involving stray radiation near organs at risk, offering precise discrimination of the mixed field, and enhancing in this way the LET calculation.",0,,"The study focuses on proton therapy rather than carbon ion therapy, despite using AI methods.","Okay, so I need to determine whether this original research article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully. The title mentions particle tracking, recognition, and LET evaluation in proton therapy with a phantom that has implants. The content talks about assessing scattered particles from proton therapy near titanium dental implants. They used an AI neural network for particle recognition to identify protons, electrons & photons, and ions & fast neutrons. The study is focused on the effects of these particles during proton therapy treatment plans. Now, the topic we're looking at is specifically about carbon ion therapy, not proton therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a different modality from proton therapy, though both are types of particle therapy. Since the article discusses proton therapy and its scattered radiation effects, it doesn't directly relate to carbon ions. Therefore, even though AI methods are applied here, they're in the context of proton therapy, which isn't within our target topic of carbon ion therapy applications. So, this article wouldn't be selected for that specific scope."
rayyan-97865227,Understanding Relative Biological Effectiveness and Clinical Outcome of Prostate Cancer Therapy Using Particle Irradiation : Analysis of Tumor Control Probability With the Modified Microdosimetric Kinetic Model,"Purpose: Recent experimental studies and clinical trial results might indicate that-at least for some indications-continued use of the mechanistic model for relative biological effectiveness (RBE) applied at carbon ion therapy facilities in Europe for several decades (LEM-I) may be unwarranted. We present a novel clinical framework for prostate cancer treatment planning and tumor control probability (TCP) prediction based on the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM) for particle therapy. Methods and Materials: Treatment plans of 91 patients with prostate tumors (proton: 46, carbon ions: 45) applying 66 GyRBE [RBE = 1.1 for protons and LEM-I, (a/b)x = 2.0 Gy, for carbon ions] in 20 fractions were recalculated using mMKM [(a/b)x = 3.1 Gy]). Based solely on the response data of photon-irradiated patient groups stratified according to risk and usage of androgen deprivation therapy, we derived parameters for an mMKM-based Poisson-TCP model. Subsequently, new carbon and helium ion plans, adhering to prescribed biological dose criteria, were generated. These were systematically compared with the clinical experience of Japanese centers employing an analogous fractionation scheme and existing proton plans. Results: mMKM predictions suggested significant biological dose deviation between the proton and carbon ion arms. Patients irradiated with protons received (3.25 f 0.08) GyRBEmMKM/Fx, whereas patients treated with carbon ions received (2.51 f 0.05) GyRBEmMKM/Fx. TCP predictions were (86 f 3)% for protons and (52 f 4)% for carbon ions, matching the clinical outcome of 85% and 50%. Newly optimized carbon ion plans, guided by the mMKM/TCP model, effectively replicated clinical data from Japanese centers. Using mMKM, helium ions exhibited similar target coverage as proton and carbon ions and improved rectum and bladder sparing compared with proton. Conclusions: Our mMKM-based model for prostate cancer treatment planning and TCP prediction was validated against clinical data for proton and carbon ion therapy, and its application was extended to helium ion therapy. Based on the data presented in this work, mMKM seems to be a good candidate for clinical biological calculations in carbon ion therapy for prostate cancer. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Let me read through it carefully. The title mentions using particle irradiation and analyzing tumor control probability with a modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM). The purpose is about evaluating whether the current RBE model used in Europe for carbon ion therapy is still valid, and they're presenting a new clinical framework based on mMKM. They used data from 91 patients treated with protons or carbon ions to recalibrate their models. They also compared their results with Japanese centers and looked into helium ion plans. The conclusion validates the model against clinical data for proton and carbon therapy and extends it to helium ions. Now, where does AI come into play here? The abstract talks about a modified model (mMKM) and Poisson-TCP model, but I don't see any mention of machine learning, neural networks, or other AI techniques. It seems more focused on physics-based models rather than AI applications. So, since there's no indication that AI methods are used or explored in this research, it doesn't fit the topic. Therefore, the decision should be '0'."
rayyan-97865228,Use of parvovirus B19-like particles in self-illuminated photodynamic therapy for solid tumors,"Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer photodynamic therapy, which uses light generated by bioluminescent proteins to activate photosensitizers and produce reactive oxygen species without the need for external irradiation, has shown promising results in cancer models. However, the characterization of delivery systems that can incorporate the components of this therapy for preferential delivery to the tumor remains necessary. In this work, we have characterized parvovirus B19-like particles (B19V-VLPs) as a platform for a photosensitizer and a bioluminescent protein. By chemical and biorthogonal conjugation, we conjugated rose Bengal photosensitizer and firefly luciferase to B19V-VLPs and a protein for added specificity. The results showed that B19V-VLPs can withstand decoration with all three components without affecting its structure or stability. The conjugated luciferase showed activity and was able to activate rose Bengal to produce singlet oxygen without the need for external light. The photodynamic reaction generated by the functionalized VLPs-B19 can decrease the viability of tumor cells in vitro and affect tumor growth and metastasis in the 4 T1 model. Treatment with functionalized VLPs-B19 also increased the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cell populations in the spleen and in inguinal lymph nodes compared to vehicle-treated mice. Our results support B19V-VLPs as a delivery platform for bioluminescent photodynamic therapy components to solid tumors.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods and is unrelated to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The content talks about bioluminescence resonance energy transfer photodynamic therapy, which uses light from bioluminescent proteins to activate photosensitizers and produce reactive oxygen species without external irradiation. They've characterized these virus-like particles as a delivery platform for the necessary components of this therapy. They conjugated rose Bengal photosensitizer and firefly luciferase to these VLPs along with another protein for specificity. The results show that the VLPs can carry all three components without structural issues, and the system works effectively in vitro and in an animal model. It also shows some immune response effects, increasing CD4 and CD8 cell populations. So, this is about a novel delivery method using virus-like particles for photodynamic therapy in cancer treatment. Now, looking at the topic again: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of X-rays or protons. It's known for better dose distribution and sparing surrounding tissues. Applications of AI here could involve optimization of treatment plans, predictive modeling, image analysis, etc. The article I'm reviewing doesn't mention anything about AI methods. It's focused on a delivery system using virus-like particles for photodynamic therapy, which is a different modality altogether from carbon ion therapy. There's no discussion or application of AI techniques in this context. Therefore, it doesn't fall within the scope of the topic provided. So, I should mark it as 0 and explain that there are no AI methods explored since the article isn't related to AI applications in carbon ion therapy."
rayyan-97865231,Carbon Ion and Photon Radiation Therapy Show Enhanced Antitumoral Therapeutic Ef fi cacy With Neoantigen RNA-LPX Vaccines in Preclinical Colon Carcinoma Models,"Purpose: Personalized liposome-formulated mRNA vaccines (RNA-LPX) are a powerful new tool in cancer immunotherapy. In preclinical tumor models, RNA-LPX vaccines are known to achieve potent results when combined with conventional X-ray radiation therapy (XRT). Densely ionizing radiation used in carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) may induce distinct effects in combination with immunotherapy compared with sparsely ionizing X-rays. Methods and Materials: Within this study, we investigate the potential of CIRT and isoeffective doses of XRT to mediate tumor growth inhibition and survival in murine colon adenocarcinoma models in conjunction with neoantigen (neoAg)-speci fi c RNA-LPX vaccines encoding both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I - and class II - restricted tumor -speci fi c neoantigens. We characterize tumor immune in fi ltrates and antigen -speci fi c T cell responses by fl ow cytometry and interferon - g enzyme -linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) analyses, respectively. Results: NeoAg RNA-LPX vaccines signi fi cantly potentiate radiation therapy - mediated tumor growth inhibition. CIRT and XRT alone marginally prime neoAg-speci fi c T cell responses detected in the tumors but not in the blood or spleens of mice. In fi ltration and cytotoxicity of neoAg-speci fi c T cells is strongly driven by RNA-LPX vaccines and is accompanied by reduced expression of the inhibitory markers PD -1 and Tim -3 on these cells. The neoAg RNA-LPX vaccine shows similar overall therapeutic ef fi cacy in combination with both CIRT and XRT, even if the physical radiation dose is lower for carbon ions than for Xrays. Conclusions: We hence conclude that the combination of CIRT and neoAg RNA-LPX vaccines is a promising strategy for the treatment of radioresistant tumors. (c) 2024 The Authors.

rayyan-97865232,Carbon Ion Injection System for a Complex of Radiation Therapy,"A project to create a complex of radiation therapy with a beam of carbon ions for the purpose of creating technology for the treatment of radioresistant oncological neoplasms is being considered at the site of the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute, Institute of High Energy Physics, in Protvino [1, 2]. The accelerator complex will consist of the following main parts: laser ion source, matching channel, linear accelerator, ion synchrotron. The linear accelerator must provide at the output a pulse current of accelerated C+4 ions of at least 1 mA. The radio-frequency quadruple (RFQ) is supposed to be used as the first section of the linear accelerator. Modeling of the injection system for a linear accelerator includes calculations of the ion extraction system, the matching channel, and the beam dynamics in RFQ to assess the quality of the beam at the RFQ output. As a result of the calculations, a C+4 carbon ion beam injection system has been developed that increases the beam emittance in the matching channel of no more than 30% and makes possible the diagnostics and correction of the beam up to RFQ and the almost complete capture of the beam in the accelerating system.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this abstract falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-97865233,Carbon ion radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma provides excellent local control: The prospective phase I PROMETHEUS trial,"Background & Aims: Inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be treated by stereotactic body radiotherapy. However, carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is more effective for sparing non -tumorous liver. High linear energy transfer could promote therapy ef ficacy. Japanese and Chinese studies on hypofractionated CIRT have yielded excellent results. Because of different radiobiological models and the different etiological spectrum of HCC, applicability of these results to European cohorts and centers remains questionable. The aim of this prospective study was to assess safety and ef ficacy and to determine the optimal dose of CIRT with active raster scanning based on the local effect model (LEM) I. Methods: CIRT was performed every other day in four fractions with relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted fraction doses of 8.1 -10.5 Gy (total doses 32.4 -42.0 Gy [RBE]). Dose escalation was performed in five dose levels with at least three patients each. The primary endpoint was acute toxicity after 4 weeks. Results: Twenty patients received CIRT (median age 74.7 years, n = 16 with liver cirrhosis, Child -Pugh scores [CP] A5 [n = 10], A6 [n = 4], B8 [n = 1], and B9 [n = 1]). Median follow up was 23 months. No dose -limiting toxicities and no toxicities exceeding grade II occurred, except one grade III gamma-glutamyltransferase elevation 12 months after CIRT, synchronous to out -of - field hepatic progression. During 12 months after CIRT, no CP elevation occurred. The highest dose level could be applied safely. No local recurrence developed during follow up. The objective response rate was 80%. Median overall survival was 30.8 months (1/2/3 years: 75%/64%/22%). Median progression -free survival was 20.9 months (1/2/3 years: 59%/43%/43%). Intrahepatic progression outside of the CIRT target volume was the most frequent pattern of progression. Conclusions: CIRT of HCC yields excellent local control without dose -limiting toxicity. Impact and implications: To date, safety and ef ficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma have only been evaluated prospectively in Japanese and Chinese studies. The optimal dose and fractionation when using the local effect model for radiotherapy planning are unknown. The results are of particular interest for European and American particle therapy centers, but also of relevance for all specialists involved in the treatment and care of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, as we present the first prospective data on carbon ion radiotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma outside of Asia. The excellent local control should encourage further use of carbon ion radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma and design of randomized controlled trials.

Let me start by understanding what each part means. An original research article is one that presents new findings from experiments or studies, not a review of existing literature. The topic here is about how AI is applied in carbon ion therapy, which is a type of radiation treatment using carbon ions instead of traditional X-rays. Carbon ion therapy can be more precise and effective for certain cancers because it delivers higher doses to the tumor while sparing surrounding healthy tissue due to its physical properties like the Bragg peak effect. Now, looking at the abstract provided: The title mentions 'Carbon ion radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma' and refers to a prospective phase I trial called PROMETHEUS. The background talks about treating inoperable HCC with stereotactic body radiotherapy but highlights that CIRT is more effective for sparing non-tumorous liver tissue because of high linear energy transfer promoting therapy efficacy. They mention studies from Japan and China showing excellent results, but question the applicability to European cohorts due to different radiobiological models and etiological spectra of HCC. The aim was to assess safety, efficacy, and determine optimal dose using CIRT with active raster scanning based on the local effect model (LEM) I. Methods include performing CIRT every other day in four fractions with specific RBE-weighted doses. They did a dose escalation across five levels with at least three patients each. Primary endpoint was acute toxicity after 4 weeks. Results show no dose-limiting toxicities, high response rate, and excellent local control without recurrence during follow-up. Conclusions state that CIRT yields excellent local control without significant toxicity and is safe. Impact includes being the first prospective data outside Asia, encouraging further use and randomized trials. Now, considering whether this falls under 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. The abstract discusses a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of CIRT for HCC patients. It mentions using active raster scanning based on the local effect model (LEM) I but doesn't specify any AI methods involved in the treatment planning, delivery, or analysis. Active raster scanning is a technique used to deliver precise radiation doses by scanning the beam across the target area, which can be automated with some computational methods, but unless it's explicitly stated that AI algorithms are being used for optimization, dose calculation, image recognition, etc., it doesn't qualify as an application of AI. The abstract focuses on the clinical outcomes and safety profile rather than any AI applications in therapy planning or delivery. Therefore, this article is more about the clinical trial results of CIRT without incorporating AI methods. So, I should mark it as 0 because there's no mention of AI being applied in their research."

It is called the RKP+PHS+poly approximation, and its convergence rate is of order O ( h m +1 ) , where m is the total degree of polynomials. We apply this method to construct the spaces of trial and test functions in a Galerkin scheme of an extended version of the biological mathematical model in two dimensions describing the interactions between endothelial cells, fibronectin, angiogenic growth factors, and fasentin concentrations. By considering the rowsum method, the eigenvalue stability is also numerically carried out for the discrete equations corresponding to the obtained weak formulation. Accordingly, a semi-implicit form of the backward difference method of order 1 (SBDF1) has been utilized to approximate the weak form in time. We complete our numerical algorithm by solving the obtained full-discretized problem overtime via the biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB) solver with a proper preconditioner. Some simulation results are investigated by estimating the maximum velocity parameter of an enzymatic reaction from the experimental dose-response curve of fasentin to demonstrate the effect of using fasentin drug.",0,,The article does not discuss applications of AI in carbon ion therapy; it presents a meshfree method for modeling anti-angiogenic therapy without mentioning AI or carbon ions.,"The abstract discusses a new meshfree approximation method combining reproducing kernel particle shape functions with scalable polyharmonic spline radial kernels.

However, Anti-tumor immune responses between X-ray RT (XRT) and carbon-ion RT (CIRT) remain unclear. In this study, we, employed mouse models to assess the immunological contribution, especially cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immunity, to the therapeutic effectiveness of XRT and CIRT in shrinking tumors. We irradiated mouse intradermal tumors of B16F10ovalbumin (OVA) mouse melanoma cells and 3LL-OVA mouse lung cancer cells with carbon-ion beams or Xrays in the presence or absence of CTLs. CTL removal was performed by administration of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in mice. Based on tumor growth delay, we determined the tumor growth and regression curves. The enhancement ratio (ER) of the slope of regression lines in the presence of CTLs, relative to the absence of CTLs, indicates the dependency of RT on CTLs for shrinking mouse tumors, and the biological effectiveness (RBE) of CIRT relative to XRT were calculated. Tumor growth curves revealed that the elimination of CD8+ CTLs by administrating anti-CD8 mAb accelerated tumor growth compared to the presence of CTLs in both RTs. The ERs were larger in CIRT compared to XRT in the B16F10-OVA tumor models, but not in the 3LL-OVA models, suggesting a greater contribution of CTL-mediated anti-tumor immunity to tumor reduction in CIRT compared to XRT in the B16F10-OVA tumor model. In addition, the RBE values for both models were larger in the presence of CTLs compared to models without CTLs, suggesting that CIRT may utilize CTL-mediated anti-tumor immunity more than X-ray. The findings from this study suggest that although immunological contribution to therapeutic efficacy may vary depending on the type of tumor cell, CIRT utilizes CTL-mediated immunity to a greater extent compared to XRT.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on biological mechanisms comparing carbon-ion and X-ray radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

They calculated enhancement ratios and RBE values, finding that CIRT relies more on CTL-mediated immunity than XRT in certain tumor models. The conclusion suggests that while the immune contribution varies by tumor type, CIRT uses this mechanism more effectively.

The aim of this work was to characterize various available 3D printing methods and epoxy-based materials with the specific goal of identifying suitable tissue surrogates for dosimetry applications in particle therapy.Methods 3D-printed and epoxy-based mixtures of varying ratios combining epoxy resin, bone meal, and polyethylene powder were scanned in a single-energy computed tomography (CT), a dual-energy CT, and a mu CT scanner. Their CT-predicted attenuation was compared to measurements in a 148.2 MeV proton and 284.7 MeV/u carbon ion beam. The sample homogeneity was evaluated in the respective CT images and in the carbon beam, additionally via widening of the Bragg peak. To assess long-term stability attenuation, size and weight measurements were repeated after 6-12 months.Results Four 3D-printed materials, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polylactic acid, fused deposition modeling printed nylon, and selective laser sintering printed nylon, and various ratios of epoxy-based mixtures were found to be suitable tissue surrogates. The materials' predicted stopping power ratio matched the measured stopping power ratio within 3% for all investigated CT machines and protocols, except for mu CT scans employing cone beam CT technology. The heterogeneity of the suitable surrogate samples was adequate, with a maximum Bragg peak width increase of 11.5 +/- 2.5%. The repeat measurements showed no signs of degradation after 6-12 months.Conclusion We identified surrogates for soft tissue and low- to medium-density bone among the investigated materials.

rayyan-97865238,An essentially radiation-transparent body coil integrated with a patient rotation system for MR-guided particle therapy,"BackgroundThe pursuit of adaptive radiotherapy using MR imaging for better precision in patient positioning puts stringent demands on the hardware components of the MR scanner. Particularly in particle therapy, the dose distribution and thus the efficacy of the treatment is susceptible to beam attenuation from interfering materials in the irradiation path. This severely limits the usefulness of conventional imaging coils, which contain highly attenuating parts such as capacitors and preamplifiers in an unknown position, and requires development of a dedicated radiofrequency (RF) coil with close consideration of the materials and components used.PurposeIn MR-guided radiation therapy in the human torso, imaging coils with a large FOV and homogeneous B1 field distribution are required for reliable tissue classification. In this work, an imaging coil for MR-guided particle therapy was developed with minimal ion attenuation while maintaining flexibility in treatment.MethodsA birdcage coil consisting of nearly radiation-transparent materials was designed and constructed for a closed-bore 1.5 T MR system. Additionally, the coil was mounted on a rotatable patient capsule for flexible positioning of the patient relative to the beam. The ion attenuation of the RF coil was investigated in theory and via measurements of the Bragg peak position. To characterize the imaging quality of the RF coil, transmit and receive field distributions were simulated and measured inside a homogeneous tissue-simulating phantom for various rotation angles of the patient capsule ranging from 0 degrees to 345 degrees in steps of 15 degrees. Furthermore, simulations with a heterogeneous human voxel model were performed to better estimate the effect of real patient loading, and the RF coil was compared to the internal body coil in terms of SNR for a full rotation of the patient capsule.ResultsThe RF coil (total water equivalent thickness (WET) approximate to 420 mu m, WET of conductor approximate to 210 mu m) can be considered to be radiation-transparent, and a measured transmit power efficiency (B1+/P$\sqrt {\mathrm{P}} $) between 0.17 mu T/W$\sqrt {\mathrm{W}} $ and 0.26 mu T/W$\sqrt {\mathrm{W}} $ could be achieved in a volume (Delta z = 216 mm, complete x and y range) for the 24 investigated rotation angles of the patient capsule. Furthermore, homogeneous transmit and receive field distributions were measured and simulated in the transverse, coronal and sagittal planes in a homogeneous phantom and a human voxel model. In addition, the SNR of the radiation-transparent RF coil varied between 103 and 150, in the volume (Delta z = 216 mm) of a homogeneous phantom and surpasses the SNR of the internal body coil for all rotation angles of the patient capsule.ConclusionsA radiation-transparent RF coil was developed and built that enables flexible patient to beam positioning via full rotation capability of the RF coil and patient relative to the beam, with results providing promising potential for adaptive MR-guided particle therapy.",0,,The article focuses on hardware development for MR-guided particle therapy without mentioning any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions an MR-guided particle therapy system with a radiation-transparent body coil and patient rotation. The background talks about adaptive radiotherapy using MRI for better precision, which makes sense in the context of particle therapy where beam attenuation is a big issue. They developed an RF coil that's almost transparent to radiation, which helps maintain treatment efficacy without interfering materials. The methods include designing this coil with specific materials, mounting it on a rotatable patient capsule, and testing its ion attenuation through Bragg peak measurements and simulations. Results show good performance in terms of SNR and homogeneous field distribution across different rotation angles. Conclusions highlight the potential for adaptive MR-guided particle therapy. Now, looking at the topic again: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. The abstract doesn't mention anything about artificial intelligence methods or techniques. It's more focused on hardware development—specifically an RF coil—and its integration with a patient rotation system to improve imaging and treatment delivery. There's no discussion of machine learning algorithms, data analysis using AI, or any AI-driven decision-making processes in the therapy. So, while it's related to particle therapy (which could include carbon ions), it doesn't address how AI is applied within that context.

rayyan-97865239,"Combined, yet separate: cocktails of carriers (not drugs) for actinium-225 α-particle therapy of solid tumors expressing moderate-to-low levels of targetable markers","Alpha-particle radionuclide-antibody conjugates are being clinically evaluated against solid tumors even when they moderately express the targeted markers. At this limit of lower tumor-absorbed doses, to maintain efficacy, the few(er) intratumorally delivered alpha-particles need to traverse/hit as many different cancer cells as possible. We complement antibody-radioconjugate therapies with a separate nanocarrier delivering a fraction of the same total injected radioactivity to tumor regions geographically different than those affected by targeting antibodies; these carrier-cocktails collectively distribute the alpha-particle emitters better. Methods The efficacy of actinium-225 delivered by our carrier-cocktails was assessed in vitro and on mice with orthotopic MDA-MB-436 and/or MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancers and/or an ectopic BxPC3 pancreatic cancer. Cells/tumors were chosen to express low-to-moderate levels of HER1, as model antibody-targeted marker. Results Independent of cell line, antibody-radioconjugates were most lethal on cell monolayers. On spheroids, with radii greater than alpha-particles' range, carrier-cocktails improved killing efficacy (p < 0.0500). Treatment with carrier-cocktails decreased the MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor volumes by 73.7% and 72.1%, respectively, relative to treatment with antibody-radioconjugates alone, at same total injected radioactivity; these carrier-cocktails completely eliminated formation of spontaneous metastases vs. 50% and 25% elimination in mice treated with antibody-radioconjugates alone. In BxPC3 tumor-bearing mice, carrier-cocktails increased the median survival to 25-26 days (in male-female animals) vs. 20-21 days of mice treated with antibody-radioconjugates alone (vs. 17 days for non-treated animals). Survival with carrier-cocktail radiotherapy was further prolonged by pre-injecting low-dose, standard-of-care, gemcitabine (p = 0.0390). Conclusion Tumor-agnostic carrier-cocktails significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of existing alpha-particle radionuclide-antibody treatments.",0,[],"The article focuses on alpha-particle therapy using antibody-radioconjugates and nanocarriers, which is unrelated to AI applications in carbon ion therapy.","Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the article is about. The title mentions something about cocktails of carriers for Actinium-225 alpha-particle therapy. From the content, it seems they're talking about using antibody-radioconjugates and nanocarriers to deliver radioactivity more effectively in solid tumors that don't express high levels of target markers. They tested this approach on different cancer models and found improved efficacy compared to just using antibody-radioconjugates alone. The conclusion is that these carrier-cocktails enhance the therapeutic effect without being specific to a particular tumor type. Now, looking at the topic again, it's about AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of X-rays or protons. It's known for its high precision and effectiveness in certain types of cancers. The article I'm reviewing doesn't mention anything about AI methods like machine learning, neural networks, or any computational techniques. Instead, it focuses on the delivery mechanisms of alpha-particle emitters using antibodies and nanocarriers. There's no discussion of algorithms, data analysis, predictive models, or optimization techniques that would fall under AI applications. The topic is specifically about how AI is used in carbon ion therapy, which involves things like treatment planning, dose calculation, patient positioning, or outcome prediction using AI tools. Since this article doesn't touch on any of those aspects and instead talks about a different type of radiation (alpha-particles) and delivery systems, it doesn't fit the scope of the topic. Therefore, I should not select this article for inclusion under the given topic."
rayyan-97865243,Development of porous structure for broadening Bragg-peak in scanning carbon-ion radiotherapy: Monte Carlo simulation and experimental validation,"Purpose: The present study aimed to develop a porous structure with plug-ins (PSP) to broaden the Bragg peak width (BPW, defined as the distance in water between the proximal and distal 80% dose) of the carbon ion beam while maintaining a sharp distal falloff width (DFW, defined as the distance along the beam axis where the dose in water reduces from 80% to 20%). Methods: The binary voxel models of porous structure (PS) and PSP were established in the Monte Carlo code FLUKA and the corresponding physical models were manufactured by 3D printing. Both experiment and simulation were performed for evaluating the modulation capacity of PS and PSP. BPWs and DFWs derived from each integral depth dose curves were compared. Fluence homogeneity of 430 MeV/u carbon-ion beam passing through the PSP was recorded by analyzing radiochromic films at six different locations downstream the PSP in the experiment. Additionally, by changing the beam spot size and incident position on the PSP, totally 48 different carbon-ion beams were simulated and corresponding deviations of beam metrics were evaluated to test the modulating stability of PSP. Results: According to the measurement data, the use of PSP resulted in an average increase of 0.63 mm in BPW and a decrease of 0.74 mm in DFW compared to PS. The 2D radiation field inhomogeneities were lower than 3 % when the beam passing through a >= 10 cm PMMA medium. Furthermore, employing a spot size of >= 6 mm ensures that beam metric deviations, including BPW, DFW, and range, remain within a deviation of 0.1 mm across various incident positions. Conclusion: The developed PSP demonstrated its capability to effectively broaden the BPW of carbon ion beams while maintaining a sharp DFW comparing to PS. The superior performance of PSP, indicates its potential for clinical use in the future.",0,,The study does not involve any AI methods but focuses on Monte Carlo simulations and experimental validation for modifying carbon-ion beam properties.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Hmm, so they're talking about modifying the beam's properties by creating a specific structure. They used FLUKA, which is a Monte Carlo code, but I don't see any mention of AI methods here. The abstract talks about simulations, experiments with 3D printed models, measuring BPW and DFW, and testing fluence homogeneity. There's also some analysis using radiochromic films and evaluating beam metrics under different conditions. But where is the AI part? They didn't mention machine learning, neural networks, or any other AI techniques in their methods. It seems like they're doing physics simulations and experiments without involving AI.

rayyan-97865244,SENTRI: Single-Particle Energy Transducer for Radionuclide Injections for Personalized Targeted Radionuclide Cancer Therapy,"Purpose: Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT), whereby a tumor-targeted molecule is linked to a therapeutic beta- or alpha-emitting radioactive nuclide, is a promising treatment modality for patients with metastatic cancer, delivering radiation systemically. However, patients still progress due to suboptimal dosing, driven by the large patient-to-patient variability. Therefore, the ability to continuously monitor the real-time dose deposition in tumors and organs at risk provides an additional dimension of information during clinical trials that can enable insights into better strategies to personalize TRT. Methods and Materials: Here, we present a single beta-particle sensitive dosimeter consisting of a 0.27-mm(3) monolithic silicon chiplet directly implanted into the tumor. To maximize the sensitivity and have enough detection area, minimum-size diodes (1 mu m(2)) are arrayed in 64 x 64. Signal amplifiers, buffers, and on-chip memories are all integrated in the chip. For verification, PC3-PIP (prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA]+) and PC3-flu (PSMA-) cell lines are injected into the left and right flanks of the mice, respectively. The devices are inserted into each tumor and measure activities at 5 different time points (0-2 hours, 7-9 hours, 12-14 hours, 24-26 hours, and 48-50 hours) after Lu-177-PSMA-617 injections. Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography scans are used to verify measured data. Results: With a wide detection range from 0.013 to 8.95 MBq/mL, the system is capable of detecting high tumor uptake as well as low doses delivered to organs at risk in real time. The measurement data are highly proportional (R-2 > 0.99) to the Lu-177-PSMA-617 activity. The in vivo measurement data agree well with the single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography results within acceptable errors (+/- 1.5%ID/mL). Conclusions: Given the recent advances in clinical use of TRT in prostate cancer, the proposed system is verified in a prostate cancer mouse model using Lu-177-PSMA-617. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

rayyan-97865245,Impact of dose volume parameters and clinical characteristics on radiation-induced acute oral mucositis for head and neck cancer patients treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy dose volume outcome analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the predictive value of different dosimetric parameters for acute radiation oral mucositis (ROM) in head and neck cancer (HNCs) patients treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). METHODS: 44 patients with HNCs treated with CIRT were evaluated for acute ROM which was defined as severe when the score ≥3 (acute ROM was scored prospectively using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score system). Predictive dosimetric factors were identified by using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Male gender, weight loss >5%, and total dose/fractions were related factors to severe ROM. In multivariate analysis, grade ≥3 ROM was significantly related to the Dmax, D10, D15, and D20 (P < 0.05, respectively). As the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve shows, the area under the curve (AUC) for D10 was 0.77 (p = 0.003), and the cutoff value was 51.06 Gy (RBE); The AUC for D15 was 0.75 (p = 0.006), and the cutoff value was 42.82 Gy (RBE); The AUC for D20 was 0.74 (p = 0.009), and the cutoff value was 30.45 Gy (RBE); The AUC for Dmax was 0.81 (p < 0.001), and the cutoff value was 69.33 Gy (RBE). CONCLUSION: Male gender, weight loss, and total dose/fractions were significantly association with ROM. Dmax, D10, D15 and D20 were identified as the most valuable predictor and we suggest a Dmax limit of 69.33 Gy (RBE), D10 limit of 51.06 Gy (RBE), D15 limit of 42.82 Gy (RBE), and D20 limit of 30.45 Gy (RBE) and for oral mucosa.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods; it uses traditional statistical analyses to assess dosimetric parameters.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-97865246,Reduced Risk of Severe Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia in Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: A Comparative Analysis of Carbon Versus Photon Therapy.,"PURPOSE: Radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) is associated with poor prognosis in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancers. However, there are no reports comparing the effects of carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) and photon beam radiation therapy (RT) on the development of RIL. Differences in RIL after CIRT or photon beam RT and predictive factors for RIL in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study cohort included 834 patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in 2 separate institutions: 337 and 497 in the CIRT and photon beam RT groups, respectively. Severe RIL was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <0.5 × 10(9) cells/L. A 1:1 propensity score-matching analysis was performed between the CIRT and photon beam RT groups. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the development of recovery from severe RIL: no severe RIL (Group A), recovery from severe RIL (Group B), and no recovery from severe RIL (Group C). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictive value of severe RIL. The prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) were determined using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the baseline ALC and planning target volume of the CIRT and photon beam RT groups were comparable. During CCRT, the ALC of the entire cohort decreased and was significantly lower in the photon beam RT group than in the CIRT group (P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CIRT reduced severe RIL more than photon beam RT. After adjusting for other factors, the RT modality and RIL were significantly associated with OS. Photon beam RT showed a significantly worse OS than CIRT, and Group C showed a significantly worse OS than Group A. CONCLUSIONS: CIRT seems to reduce the development of severe RIL. The RT modality and development/recovery from severe RIL were associated with OS in patients who received CCRT for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

rayyan-97865247,Synergistic Effects of Melatonin on Radiosensitization in Carbon-ion Radiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite the established antitumor effectiveness and synergistic interactions of melatonin with photon irradiation, its role in carbon-ion radiotherapy remains uncertain. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms and potential clinical advantages of combining exogenous melatonin therapy with carbon-ion radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation assessed the impact of combining exogenous melatonin with photon or carbon-ion irradiation on cell-cycle modulation and DNA-repair capability using the melanoma cell line B16F10. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were conducted to explore mechanisms and evaluate potential clinical benefits, with validation performed on the osteosarcoma cell line LM8. RESULTS: Pre-treatment with melatonin reduced the survival fraction of B16F10 and LM8 cells upon exposure to photon and carbon-ion radiation. Mechanistically, melatonin was found to inhibit G(2)/M arrest, preserve DNA damage, and suppress key genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair after 8 Gy carbon-ion radiation. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed favorable changes in genes associated with survival and metastasis, highlighting potential clinical significance. LM8 cells treated with melatonin exhibited increased radiosensitivity and suppression of DNA-repair proteins. CONCLUSION: The combination of exogenous melatonin not only heightened radiosensitivity and modulated hallmark tumor gene sets in vitro but also markedly suppressed the efficiency of DNA double-strand break-repair pathway, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of carbon-ion radiotherapy.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications in carbon-ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-97865248,A dosiomics approach to treatment outcome modeling in carbon ion radiotherapy for skull base chordomas.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the role of dosiomics features extracted from physical dose (D(PHYS)), RBE-weighted dose (D(RBE)) and dose-averaged Linear Energy Transfer (LET(d)), to predict the risk of local recurrence (LR) in skull base chordoma (SBC) treated with Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT). Thus, define and evaluate dosiomics-driven tumor control probability (TCP) models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 54 SBC patients were retrospectively selected for this study. A regularized Cox proportional hazard model (r-Cox) and Survival Support Vector Machine (s-SVM) were tuned within a repeated Cross Validation (CV) and patients were stratified in low/high risk of LR. Models' performance was evaluated through Harrell's concordance statistic (C-index), and survival was represented through Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. A multivariable logistic regression was fit to the selected feature sets to generate a dosiomics-driven TCP model for each map. These were compared to a reference model built with clinical parameters in terms of f-score and accuracy. RESULTS: The LETd maps reached a test C-index of 0.750 and 0.786 with r-Cox and s-SVM, and significantly separated KM curves. D(PHYS) maps and clinical parameters showed promising CV outcomes with C-index above 0.8, despite a poorer performance on the test set and patients stratification. The LETd-based TCP showed a significatively higher f-score (0.67[0.52-0.70], median[IQR]) compared to the clinical model (0.4[0.32-0.63], p < 0.025), while D(PHYS) achieved a significatively higher accuracy (D(PHYS): 0.73[0.65-0.79], Clinical: 0.6 [0.52-0.72]).

The title mentions a dosiomics approach for treatment outcome modeling in carbon ion radiotherapy for skull base chordomas. That sounds relevant because it's using some method related to dose and outcomes, which could involve AI since they're talking about models and predictions. The purpose is to investigate the role of various dosiomics features extracted from different types of doses to predict local recurrence risk. They mention defining and evaluating tumor control probability (TCP) models, which again sounds like predictive modeling, possibly involving machine learning or AI techniques. Looking at the methods section: they used a regularized Cox proportional hazard model (r-Cox), Survival Support Vector Machine (s-SVM), and multivariable logistic regression. These are all statistical methods, but some of them can be considered part of AI, especially SVM which is a machine learning algorithm. They also mention repeated cross-validation, Harrell's concordance statistic for performance evaluation, Kaplan-Meier curves for survival analysis, and comparing models using f-score and accuracy. The results show that LETd maps performed well with r-Cox and s-SVM, and the TCP model based on LETd had a higher f-score compared to clinical models. So they're applying these AI methods to predict treatment outcomes in carbon ion therapy. The conclusion supports the use of LETd as a prognostic factor and shows that their TCP modeling improved performance over clinical models. Therefore, this article is about applying AI techniques (like SVM and Cox models) to improve treatment outcome predictions in carbon ion radiotherapy for chordomas. It fits within the scope of the topic because it's an application of AI methods specifically in the context of carbon ion therapy."
rayyan-97865249,Deep learning-based voxel sampling for particle therapy treatment planning.,"Objective.Scanned particle therapy often requires complex treatment plans, robust optimization, as well as treatment adaptation. Plan optimization is especially complicated for heavy ions due to the variable relative biological effectiveness. We present a novel deep-learning model to select a subset of voxels in the planning process thus reducing the planning problem size for improved computational efficiency.Approach.Using only a subset of the voxels in target and organs at risk (OARs) we produced high-quality treatment plans, but heuristic selection strategies require manual input. We designed a deep-learning model based onP-Net to obtain an optimal voxel sampling without relying on patient-specific user input. A cohort of 70 head and neck patients that received carbon ion therapy was used for model training (50), validation (10) and testing (10). For training, a total of 12 500 carbon ion plans were optimized, using a highly efficient artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure implemented into a research treatment planning platform. A custom loss function increased sampling density in underdosed regions, while aiming to reduce the total number of voxels.Main results.On the test dataset, the number of voxels in the optimization could be reduced by 84.8% (median) at <1% median loss in plan quality. When the model was trained to reduce sampling in the target only while keeping all voxels in OARs, a median reduction up to 71.6% was achieved, with 0.5% loss in the plan quality. The optimization time was reduced by a factor of 7.5 for the total AI selection model and a factor of 3.7 for the model with only target selection.Significance.The novel deep-learning voxel sampling technique achieves a significant reduction in computational time with a negligible loss in the plan quality. The reduction in optimization time can be especially useful for future real-time adaptation strategies.",1,"['P-Net', 'Custom loss function', 'Deep learning techniques']","The article presents an application of deep learning in optimizing treatment plans for carbon ion therapy, specifically addressing computational efficiency and plan quality.","Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-283077591,Prognostic value of pre-treatment metabolic tumor volume on [S‑methyl‑(11)C]‑L‑methionine PET/CT in patients with local non-small cell lung carcinoma treated with single-fraction carbon-ion radiotherapy.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic predictive ability of MET PET/CT-derived imaging biomarkers in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing single-fraction carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and to clarify the additional prognostic information these biomarkers can provide beyond the standard UICC staging protocol. METHODS: With institutional review board approval, 67 localized NSCLC patients eligible for CIRT between 2007 and 2012 were included. Single-fraction doses of 40-50 Gy were irradiated. MET PET imaging using the Toshiba Aquiduo or Siemens Biograph 16 commenced 20 min post 740 MBq MET injection before CIRT. Experienced radiologists analyzed the images, defining metabolic tumor volume (MTV) as areas with SUV > 1.5. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 29, including Cox proportional hazard models for disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Seven cases with Tis of T stage were excluded because of low MET radiotracer uptake. A total of 60 patients were analyzed: 36 males and 24 females with a mean age of 73 years; 35 cases of T1, 24 cases of T2, and one T3 case. The average follow-up period was 74.3 months. The univariate Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that SUVmax, MTV, and total lesion retention (TLR) correlated with disease-free survival (DFS), while no significant difference was noted in treatment dose. For overall survival (OS), solid tumor diameter, SUVmax, MTV, TLR, and sex showed significant correlations in the univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis identified MTV as the only significant prognostic factor for both DFS and OS. Kaplan-Meier survival curves further supported these findings, with log-rank tests indicating a significant difference in survival duration related to MTV in both DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: MTV in pre-treatment MET PET/CT would be a valuable predictor of DFS and OS of localized NSCLC treated with single-fraction CIRT.",0,,The study does not explore any AI methods; it uses conventional statistical analysis to evaluate imaging biomarkers in carbon-ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 3-channel conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) was trained and tested on twenty-six patients, using paired T1-weighted 4DMRI and 4DCT volumes. 4D-sCT data were generated via the cGAN following a 3-channels segmentation approach (air, bone, soft tissue) in two scenarios: (a) 4DCT-based approach (i.e. segmentation relying on 4DCT) and (b) 4DMRI-based approach (i.e. manual segmentation on 4DMRI, to simulate a 4DMRI-only scenario). The network was first validated on a 4D computational phantom, where a ground truth dataset was available. Subsequently, the network was tested on 6 independent held-out-of-training patients. Generated volumes were evaluated with respect to the original 4DCT based on motion analysis, similarity metrics (e.g. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Cross Coefficient (NCC)) and dosimetric criteria, by means of recalculating clinically optimized CIRT plans on the 4D-sCT. RESULTS: For the phantom, similarity metrics were in line with literature results, while dose volume histogram values were below 0.9 %. 4DCT-based patient results demonstrated an accurate representation with respect to the original 4DCT images (MAE: 50.64-51.29 HU), while 4DMRI-only-based results yielded higher values (MAE: 81.15-90.22 HU). Gamma pass rates (3 %/3mm) were ∼ 97 % for the 4DCT-based scenario, showing dosimetric consistency between the compared 4DCT and 4D-sCT dose distributions. D95% values on GTV/CTV were within clinical tolerances for the 4DMRI-only scenario. CONCLUSION: Deep learning-based 4D-sCT generation shows potential to support treatment planning in abdominal tumors treated with CIRT.",1,"['Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)', 'Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)']",The article explores the application of deep learning in generating synthetic 4DCT for treatment planning in carbon-ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The purpose is about feasibility of generating 4D-sCT using deep learning for CIRT patients. They used a cGAN model trained on paired MRI and CT data. The results show that the generated images are accurate with good similarity metrics and dosimetric consistency. This seems directly applicable to carbon ion therapy, as it's improving treatment planning by synthesizing necessary imaging data without needing additional scans.

We investigated the incidence of RILSP and the associated dosimetric parameters using data from a prospective study of CIRT for postoperative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer (GUNMA 0801). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The GUNMA 0801 study included 28 patients, of which we analyzed 20 without lumbosacral plexopathy prior to CIRT. The total dose of CIRT was 73.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) in 16 fractions. The incidence of RILSP and parameters of the dose-volume histogram were evaluated for the lumbosacral plexuses. RILSP was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 24 months. The incidence of all RILSP (grades 1 and 2) and grade 2 RILSP was 22.5% (9/40) and 10% (4/40) of 40 lumbosacral plexuses in 20 patients, respectively, and no grade ≥ 3 toxicity was observed. Throughout the dose range, the volumes of the irradiated lumbosacral plexuses were significantly higher in patients with RILSP than in patients without RILSP (P < .001 for Dmax, D0.5 cm(3) - D2 cm(3), V20 Gy(RBE) - V70 Gy(RBE)). D2 cm(3) and V50 Gy(RBE) were considered useful for receiver operating characteristic analysis. Cutoff values for RILSP were 73.82 Gy(RBE) and 33.2% for D2 cm(3) and V50 Gy(RBE), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the incidence and predictive dosimetric parameters for RILSP after CIRT and showed that D2 cm(3) ≥ 73.82 Gy(RBE) and V50 Gy(RBE) = 33.2% are cutoff values for predicting RILSP. These results would improve treatment plans using CIRT for patients with pelvic recurrences of rectal cancer.",0,[],The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on statistical analysis of dosimetric parameters to predict radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy after CIRT.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

From what I can see, the methods used are statistical analysis of dose-volume histograms, evaluating parameters like Dmax, D2 cm³, V50 Gy(RBE), etc., using receiver operating characteristic analysis. There's no mention of any machine learning algorithms, neural networks, or other AI techniques here. The study is more about dosimetry and predictive modeling without involving AI methods.

rayyan-283077594,Defective homologous recombination and genomic instability predict increased responsiveness to carbon ion radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notably resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation treatment. However, clinical trials indicate that carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with concurrent gemcitabine is effective for unresectable locally advanced PDAC. This study aimed to identify patient characteristics predictive of CIRT response. We utilized a panel of human PDAC cell lines with diverse genetic profiles to determine their sensitivity to CIRT compared to γ-rays, assessing relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at 10% survival, which ranged from 1.96 to 3.04. Increased radiosensitivity was linked to impaired DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, particularly in cell lines with deficiencies in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway and/or elevated genomic instability from replication stress. Furthermore, pretreatment with the HR inhibitor B02 significantly enhanced CIRT sensitivity in a radioresistant PDAC cell line when irradiated in the spread-out Bragg peak but not at the entry position of the beam. These findings suggest that PDAC tumors with HR pathway mutations or high replication stress are more likely to benefit from CIRT while minimizing normal tissue toxicity.",0,,The article focuses on biological factors influencing responsiveness to carbon ion radiotherapy and does not explore any AI methods or applications.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

It seems like this is more about molecular biology and radiation response rather than how AI could be applied in therapy planning, patient selection, or treatment optimization.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches in predicting grade 2 + xerostomia in adults with HNC receiving proton and carbon ion radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study involving 1,769 adults with HNC who completed proton or carbon ion radiotherapy was conducted. Xerostomia was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Eight machine learning models with different combinations sampling methods and class weights were compared to identify the model with the highest balanced accuracy. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 47.8 years (range 18-80), with 33.5 % female. The average total radiation dose was 71.0 GyE (SD = 5.7). Grade 1 xerostomia was recorded in 572 patients (32.3 %) and grade 2 in 103 patients (5.8 %). No cases of grade 3 or higher xerostomia were reported. A support vector machine with a linear kernel, a 1:2 positive-to-negative class weight, and SMOTE oversampling achieved the highest balanced accuracy (0.66) and AUC-ROC (0.69) for predicting grade 2 xerostomia, outperforming the logistic regression model (balanced accuracy:0.50, AUC-ROC. 0.67).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively included 178 patients, collecting clinical, dose-volume histogram (DVH), radiomics, and dosiomics data. Patients were randomly divided into training (70%) and test sets (30%). Feature selection involved univariable logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, stepwise backward regression, and Spearman's correlation test, with the bootstrap method ensuring reliability. Multivariable models were built on the training set and evaluated using the test set. RESULTS: The optimal NTCP model incorporated a DVH parameter (V(37Gy [relative biological effectiveness, RBE])), radiomics, and dosiomics features, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.932 in the training set and 0.959 in the test set. This hybrid model outperformed those based on single DVH, radiomics, dosiomics, or clinical data (Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.001 and ΔAUC > 0 for all comparisons in 1,000 bootstrap validations). Calibration curves showed strong agreement between predictions and outcomes. A 44.0 % AOM risk threshold was proposed, yielding accuracies of 87.1 % in the training set and 90.7 % in the test set. CONCLUSIONS: We developed the first NTCP model for estimating AOM risk in head and neck cancer patients undergoing CIRT and proposed a risk stratification. This model may assist in clinical decision-making and improve treatment planning for AOM prevention and management by identifying high-risk patients.",1,"['logistic regression', 'LASSO regression', 'stepwise backward regression', ""Spearman's correlation test"", 'bootstrap method']","The article develops a predictive model for acute oral mucositis using dosimetry, radiomics, and dosiomics in carbon ion therapy, which involves applications of AI.","Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The results mention building multivariable models with an AUC of 0.932 and 0.959, which are good performance metrics but again, not exclusively AI. The conclusion states it's the first NTCP model for CIRT, which could be seen as applying AI if machine learning was involved. But I'm a bit unsure because some of these methods are traditional statistical approaches rather than modern AI techniques like deep learning or neural networks. However, since radiomics is mentioned and that often uses AI, maybe this counts. Also, the application is in carbon ion therapy, which fits the topic.

In this study, the RBE(10)derived by this model (through the particle and heavy ion transport code system (PHITS) simulatedd(y)spectra) is compared with values of RBE(10)using experimentally derivedd(y)spectra from a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microdosimeter.Approach:experimentally measuredd(y)spectra are used to calculate an RBE(10)value utilizing the V79-RBE(10)BWF model as well as the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) to produce an RBE(10)-vs-y(D)trend for a wide range of ions. In addition, a beamline specific PHITS simulation was conducted which replicated the exact experimental conditions that were used with the SOI microdosimeter at the heavy ion medical accelerator in Chiba biological beamline with(12)C ions.Main Results:the RBE(10)-vs-y(D)trend for(1)H,(4)He,(7)Li,(12)C,(14)N,(16)O,(20)Ne,(28)Si,(56)Fe, and(124)Xe ions is examined with good agreement found between the SOI microdosimeter derived RBE(10)values with the V79-RBE(10)BWF model and MKM, as well as the PHITS simulations for(1)H,(4)He,(7)Li,(12)C,(16)O, and(56)Fe ions while some discrepancies were seen for(14)N,(20)Ne, and(28)Si ions.

During the MSAC 1638 application process, MSAC recognised the uncertainties inherent in the cost-utility modelling of PBT. To address these uncertainties, MSAC proposed the establishment of a national registry with the intention to gather evidence to validate the claim of PBT's superior toxicity outcomes and cost-effectiveness compared with conventional photon radiation therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Australian Particle Therapy Clinical Quality Registry is a prospective, observational, longitudinal registry collecting national data on paediatric, adolescent young adult and adult patients with rare tumours receiving any form of radiation therapy for a defined group of diseases, specified by the MSAC 1638 Public Summary Document. Eligible patients undergoing radiation therapy at participating institutions will be provided with information about the registry, including the opt-out procedure.

However, there is a shortage of deep learning (DL) models and workflows for predicting Monte Carlo (MC) doses in such treatments.PurposeThis study seeks to address this gap by developing a DL model for independent MC dose (MCDose) prediction, aiming to facilitate OART and rapid QA implementation for HIT.Methods and MaterialsA MC dose prediction DL model called CAM-CHD U-Net for HIT was introduced, based on the GATE/Geant4 MC simulation platform. The proposed model improved upon the original CHD U-Net by adding a Channel Attention Mechanism (CAM). Two experiments were conducted, one with CHD U-Net (Experiment 1) and another with CAM-CHD U-Net (Experiment 2), and involved data from 120 head and neck cancer patients. Using patient CT images, three-dimensional energy matrices, and ray-masks as inputs, the model completed the entire MC dose prediction process within a few seconds.ResultsIn Experiment 2, within the Planned Target Volume (PTV) region, the average gamma passing rate (3%/3 mm) between the predicted dose and true MC dose reached 99.31%, and 96.48% across all body voxels. Experiment 2 demonstrated a 46.15% reduction in the mean absolute difference in D5${D_5}$ in organs at risk compared to Experiment 1.ConclusionsBy extracting relevant parameters of radiotherapy plans, the CAM-CHD U-Net model can directly and accurately predict independent MC dose, and has a high gamma passing rate with the ground truth dose (the dose obtained after a complete MC simulation).

Conversion between current RBE predictions and introduction of novel approaches remains a challenging task. Our aim is to introduce a framework considering multiple RBE models simultaneously during CIRT plan optimization, easing the translation between D RBE prescriptions. Materials and methods: An in-house developed Monte Carlo treatment planning system was extended to incorporate the local effect model version I (LEM-I), the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM) and the MKM-derived Japanese biological model (NIRS-MKM). Four clinical cases (two head-and-neck and two prostate patients), initially optimized with LEM-I for both targets and organs at risk (OARs), underwent two further optimizations: to fulfill mMKM/NIRS-MKM-based target prescriptions (mixed-RBE approach) or to simultaneously consider two biological models within the target regions (multi-RBE approach). Both approaches retained LEM-I-derived dose constraints for OARs. Results: The developed optimization strategies have been successfully applied, fulfilling all the clinical criteria for the applied RBE models. One of the RBE models showed unfavorable dose distribution when not explicitly considered in the optimization, while multi-RBE model optimization allowed meeting dose objectives for the selected OARs for both models simultaneously. Conclusions: The introduced optimization approaches allow for mixed- or multi-RBE optimization in CIRT through the selection of RBE models independently for each region of interest.

Contribution of Nuclear Fragmentation to Dose and RBE in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy. Radiat Res. 203, 96-106 (2025). Variable relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon radiotherapy may be calculated using several models, including the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM), stochastic MKM (SMKM), repair-misrepair-fixation (RMF) model, and local effect model I (LEM), which have not been thoroughly compared. In this work, we compared how these four models handle carbon beam fragmentation, providing insight into where model differences arise. Monoenergetic and spread-out Bragg peak carbon beams incident on a water phantom were simulated using Monte Carlo. Using these beams, input parameters for each model (microdosimetric spectra, DNA double-strand break yield, kinetic energy spectra, physical dose fragment contributions) were calculated for each contributing carbon beam fragment (hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, secondary carbon, primary carbon, electrons, and other). Scored input parameters for each fragment were used to calculate linear (a) and quadratic (b) parameters according to each model, which were combined with reference a and b values and absorbed physical dose to calculate RBE. Contributions from secondary fragments were found to exceed 30% of the total physical dose. Using identical beam parameters, the four models produced not only different RBE values but also different RBE trends. In all models, RBE was highest for secondary carbon ions. Beyond secondary carbons, the RBE magnitude typically increased with the atomic number of the fragment, but RBE trends differed dramatically by model and beamline region (entrance, spread-out Bragg peak, and tail). Variations in fragment RBE were large enough to be apparent in biological dose predictions. This study demonstrated that fragmentation is a nonnegligible consideration in carbon radiotherapy. Our findings identified differences in RBE among specific fragments and the four models, contributing to variability in the total biological dose across models. Because these findings emphasize differences in how various models handle carbon beam fragments, greater care should be taken in characterization of secondary fragments in particle therapy.

rayyan-283077607,Impacts of Geant4 hadronic physics models on secondary particle productions in proton therapy simulations,"Monte Carlo simulations using the Geant4 toolkit are widely used in proton therapy to predict the dose distribution and secondary particle production. The choice of physics models used in the simulation can greatly affect the accuracy of the results. However, general hadronic models in Geant4 are not specifically tuned for medical physics regions and available experimental data are still limited. In this study, we investigated three different Geant4 hadronic physics models: BIC, BERT, and INCL++, by calculating the yields and kinematical distribution of the secondary neutron, gamma, and positron emitters as well as their incident energy dependence. The simulations were performed for a water phantom irradiated with 70 - 250 MeV proton beams. Our analysis revealed significant differences in the yields, angular, and energy distributions of emitted secondary particles between the three models. We also found a systematic underestimation of yields for the positron emitter 11 C in the recent version 10.7 of Geant4. Overall, our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting a hadronic physics model for Geant4 simulations in proton therapy. Our findings also emphasize the need for a specifically tuned Geant4 hadronic model for proton therapy applications in order to consistently reproduce a wide range of important observables.

rayyan-283077608,Validation of the generalized stochastic microdosimetric model (GSM<SUP>2</SUP>) over a broad range of LET and particle beam type: a unique model for accurate description of (therapy relevant) radiation qualities,"Objective. The present work shows the first extensive validation of the generalized stochastic microdosimetric model (GSM(2)). This mechanistic and probabilistic model is trained and tested over cell survival experiments conducted with two cell lines (H460 and H1437), three different types of radiation (protons, helium, and carbon ions), spanning a very broad LET range from 1 keV mu m(-1) up to more than 300 keV mu m(-1). Currently, the existing mechanistic radiation biophysical models show some limitations in describing cell killing without the addition of ad hoc corrections, especially in the high-LET regime, where the overkill effect is observed. Approach. The experimental irradiation conditions have been accurately reproduced with Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4-based TOPAS computational toolkit. We show the main and unique features of GSM(2), i.e. how it can predict the biological response by considering the full information on the stochasticity of radiation through the microdosimetric spectrum, which is supposed to be the best descriptor of radiation quality. Main results. Well-matching results for different biological endpoints with the natural presence of the overkill effect fully display the predictive power of GSM(2). Significance. This study shows the complete generality and flexibility of GSM(2) and its ability to successfully predict the cell survival probability from very different particle radiation fields. Consequently, we demonstrate the dependence of the relative biological effectiveness on the whole microdosimetric spectrum, which fully includes the stochasticity inherently given by radiation-matter interaction.",0,['Monte Carlo simulations'],The study focuses on validating a microdosimetric model using Monte Carlo simulations but does not specifically apply AI methods to optimize or enhance carbon ion therapy applications.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully. The title mentions validating a model called GSM² over various LET and particle types, including carbon ions. The content talks about using Monte Carlo simulations with GEANT4-based TOPAS for computational modeling. They tested it on cell lines exposed to protons, helium, and carbon ions across a broad LET range. The main focus is on the model's ability to predict biological responses based on microdosimetric spectra. While they used AI methods like machine learning in training their model, the primary application here seems to be in radiation biophysics rather than specifically in therapy optimization or treatment planning for carbon ion therapy. So, even though it involves carbon ions and some AI techniques, the article's main contribution is more about validating a biological model rather than applying AI directly to improve carbon ion therapy applications."
rayyan-283077609,Modeling absorbed alpha particle dose from diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy in changing tissue volumes,"BackgroundDiffusing alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy (""Alpha DaRT"") is a promising new radiation therapy modality for treating bulky tumors. 224Ra-carrying sources are inserted intratumorally, producing a therapeutic alpha-dose region with a total size of a few millimeter via the diffusive motion of 224Ra's alpha-emitting daughters. Clinical studies of Alpha DaRT have reported 100% positive response (30%-100% shrinkage within several weeks), with post-insertion swelling in close to half of the cases. While dosimetry recommendations informed by the effects of edema are standard in some radiation therapy modalities, the effect of edema and tumor shrinkage on the absorbed dose delivered by Alpha DaRT is still unknown.PurposeThe aim of this work is to develop a simple model for Alpha-DaRT dose deposition in a time-dependent tissue volume in order to study the effect of geometrical changes in source location due to edema and tumor shrinkage on the delivered alpha particle dose.MethodsWe perform FEM-based dose deposition modeling for a single Alpha-DaRT source inside shrinking and swelling tissues. Gradual volume change models were used for shrinkage and swelling, and an additional immediate volume gain model was also used for ""worst case"" swelling. Volume change rates were estimated from source location data from serial scans acquired at time of insertion and removal for seven patients treated using Alpha DaRT. We calculate absorbed dose profiles under both the high- and low-diffusion regimes described by the Diffusion-Leakage model.ResultsChanges in tissue volume can lead to over- or underestimation of the calculated absorbed dose. In the low-diffusion regime, gradual tissue shrinkage can result in an increase of 100% and gradual swelling can result in a 35% decrease in absorbed dose compared to a calculation in static tissue. Although immediate post-insertion swelling can reduce the absorbed dose by close to 65% for very closely spaced sources, in all cases analyzed the final absorbed dose continues to exceed the 10 Gy target. These effects are less severe in the high-diffusion regime.ConclusionsThese results indicate that tissue swelling and shrinkage can have a non-negligible effect on the tumor absorbed dose. Further study of tissue dynamics during Alpha-DaRT treatment will be necessary for improvements in dosimetry practice.",0,,"The article focuses on modeling dose deposition using finite element methods and diffusion models for Alpha DaRT, not involving any AI methods or carbon ion therapy.","Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the article is about. The title mentions modeling absorbed alpha particle dose from diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy, which is called Alpha DaRT. From the content, it's a new radiation therapy modality for bulky tumors using 224Ra-carrying sources. They're looking at how edema and tumor shrinkage affect the absorbed dose. The methods involve FEM-based modeling and Diffusion-Leakage models to calculate dose profiles under different conditions. The conclusion is that tissue changes can significantly impact the dose, so better dosimetry practices are needed. Now, I need to see if this relates to AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of photons or protons. It's known for high precision and effectiveness against certain tumors. The article here is about alpha particles from radium sources, which are different from carbon ions.

Previous JCROS studies demonstrated improved local control with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). This study evaluates early outcomes of CIRT for HNMM using the European and Japanese relative biological effectiveness (RBE)adapted dose prescriptions. Materials and Methods: Between November 2019 and April 2023, 14 HNMM patients received CIRT treatment. Postoperative CIRT for R2 resection: 9 cases; biopsies only: 5 cases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors used as primary treatment: 6 cases; salvage: 8 cases. CIRT delivered in D-RBE dose of 68.8 (64.5-68.8) Gy (RBE)/16 fractions, optimized with the local effect model I (LEM-I, European) for RBE-weighted dose, recalculated using the modified-microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM, Japanese). Results: HHNMM tumor and nodal stages: cT3: 2 (14%), cT4: 12 (86%), cN1: 1 (7%). The median follow-up was 22 months (range, 4-54). The 2-year local recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, overall survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were 100%, 89% (CI, 71-100), 64% (CI, 44-95), and 43% (CI, 22-84), respectively. The median relative volumetric tumor regression at 3, 6, and 12 months post-CIRT was 40%, 63%, and 72%, respectively. CIRT-associated late toxicities were G3 mucositis: 2 (14%) and G3 anosmia: 1 (7%). The immune checkpoint inhibition-related late toxicities were G2 hypophysitis: 1 (11%) and G3 peripheral neuropathy: 1 (11%). The average attainable D-RBE coverage for 95% of high-dose clinical target volume was 63.2 +/- 6 Gy (RBE) (LEM-I) and 57.4 +/- 5 Gy (RBE) (mMKM). The LETd distribution in high-dose clinical target volume was satisfactory, LETd(50%) (median) = 57.3 +/- 6 keV/mu m and LETd(98%) (near minimum) = 46.5 +/- 6.1 keV/mu m. Conclusion: Bi-RBE model (LEM-I, mMKM) optimized CIRT protocol improved dose comparability of plans between different systems. It also improved intratumoral LETd distribution and resulted in rapid tumor regression, favorable toxicity profile, and excellent early loco-regional control. It provides a promising alternative to surgery, though distant metastasis remains the key prognostic factor.",0,[],The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on clinical outcomes and RBE-weighted dose reporting using two models.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Methods The beam model commissioning entailed employing 1D single beams and 2D monoenergetic fields to validate spot profiles with films, assess beam range using Peakfinder measurements, and evaluate fragment spectra through dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) calculations. 3D dose distributions were verified in homogeneous phantoms for both absorbed and relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted doses, and further assessed in double wedge and anthropomorphic phantoms for absorbed dose only. Finally, RBE-weighted dose verification and patient-specific quality assurance were conducted using 58 beams from 20 clinically treated patient plans. Results The results demonstrated good agreement in absolute dose distribution between TPS calculations and measurements, with mean dose discrepancies within 3%. However, deviations were slightly higher (> 1%) for the cases involving the range shifter (RaShi) compared to those without the RaShi (< 1%). Beam range, depth dose distribution, and lateral profiles of spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) closely matched between RS TPS calculations and measurements. Some discrepancies (less than 0.5 mm) were observed at field edges and in penumbra regions due to limitations in simulating asymmetrical spots, but within clinical tolerance. After model tuning, RBE-weighted dose calculations in RS TPS were in agreement with those from the clinically used TPS, except for variations exceeding 3% observed at energies exceeding 408.07 MeV/u, primarily attributed to fragment spectra differences. Conclusion Overall, this study validated the RS TPS for calculating absorbed doses against measurements and RBE-weighted doses against a clinically used TPS.

The effect of absorbed dose heterogeneity in nephrotoxicity is, however, not fully understood yet, which hampers the implementation of treatment optimization by obscuring the interpretation of clinical response data and the selection of optimal treatment options. Although some dosimetry methods have been developed for kidney dosimetry to the level of microscopic renal substructures, the clinical assessment of the microscopic distribution of radiopharmaceuticals in kidney tissues currently remains a challenge. This restricts the anatomical resolution of clinical dosimetry, which hinders a thorough clinical investigation of the impact of absorbed dose heterogeneity. The potential of absorbed dose-response modelling to support individual treatment optimization in radiopharmaceutical therapy is recognized and gaining attraction. However, biophysical modelling is currently underexplored for the kidney, where particular modelling challenges arise from the convolution of a complex functional organization of renal tissues with the function-mediated dose distribution of radiopharmaceuticals. This article reviews and discusses the heterogeneity of absorbed dose distribution in kidney tissues and the absorbed dose-response modelling of nephrotoxicity in radiopharmaceutical therapy.

rayyan-283077617,Nuclear interaction correction based on dual-energy computed tomography in carbon-ion radiotherapy,"Objective. Accurate dose predictions are crucial to maximizing the benefits of carbon-ion therapy (CIT). Carbon beams incident on the human body cause nuclear interactions with tissues, resulting in changes in the constituent nuclides and leading to dose errors that are conventionally corrected using conventional single-energy computed tomography (SECT). Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has frequently been used for stopping power estimation in particle therapy and is well suited for correcting nuclear reactions because of its detailed body-tissue elemental information. This study proposes a correction method for the absolute dose in CIT that considers changes in nuclide composition resulting from nuclear reactions with body tissues, as a novel application of DECT. Approach. The change in dose associated with nuclear reactions is determined by correcting each integrated depth dose component of the carbon beam using a nuclear interaction correction factor. This factor is determined based on the stopping power, mass density, and nuclear interaction cross-section in body tissue. The stopping power and mass density were calculated using established methods, whereas the nuclear interaction cross-section was newly defined through a conversion equation derived from the effective atomic number. Main results. Nuclear interaction correction factors and corrected doses were determined for 85 body tissues with known compositions, comparing them with existing SECT-based methods. The root-mean-square errors of the SECT- and DECT-based nuclear interaction correction factors relative to theoretical values were 0.66% and 0.39%, respectively. Significance. This indicates a notable enhancement in the estimation accuracy with DECT. The dose calculations in uniform body tissues derived from SECT showed slight over-correction in adipose and bone tissues, whereas those based on DECT were almost consistent with theoretical values. Our proposed method demonstrates the potential of DECT for enhancing dose calculation accuracy in CIT, complementing its established role in stopping power estimation.",0,,The study does not involve any artificial intelligence methods but focuses on physics-based corrections using DECT.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-283077619,Quantitative assessment of delivered dose in carbon ion spatially fractionated radiotherapy (C-SFRT) and biological response to C-SFRT,"Objective. Applying carbon ion beams, which have high linear energy transfer and low scatter within the human body, to Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) could benefit the treatment of deep-seated or radioresistant tumors. This study aims to simulate the dose distributions of spatially fractionated beams (SFB) to accurately determine the delivered dose and model the cell survival rate following SFB irradiation. Approach. Dose distributions of carbon ion beams are calculated using the Triple Gaussian Model. The sensitive volume of the detector used in measurements was also considered. If the measurements and simulations show good agreement, the dose distribution and absolute dose delivered by SFB can be accurately estimated. Three types of dose distributions were delivered to human salivary gland cells (HSGc-C5): uniform dose distribution (UDD), and onedimensional (1D) grid-like dose distributions (GDD) with 6 mm and 8 mm spacing. These provided high (Peak-to-Valley Dose Ratio, PVDR = 4.0) and low (PVDR = 1.64) dose differences between peak and valley doses, respectively. Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model parameters for HSGc-C5 were derived from the UDD and cell survival fractions (SF) were simulated for 1D GDD using these values. Main results. Good agreement was observed between measurements and simulations when accounting for detector volume. However, the TPS results overestimated dose in steep gradient region, likely due to the 2.0 mm calculation resolution. LQ parameters for HSGc-C5 were alpha = 0.34 and beta= 0.057. The 1D GDD with 6 mm spacing showed good agreement between simulations and experiments, but the 8.0 mm spacing resulted in lower experimental cell survival.Significance.

rayyan-283077622,Investigating LETd optimization strategies in carbon ion radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer: a dosimetric study using an anthropomorphic phantom,"Background Clinical carbon ion beams offer the potential to overcome hypoxia-induced radioresistance in pancreatic tumors, due to their high dose-averaged Linear Energy Transfer (LETd), as previous studies have linked a minimum LETd within the tumor to improved local control. Current clinical practices at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT), which use two posterior beams, do not fully exploit the LETd advantage of carbon ions, as the high LETd is primarily focused on the beams' distal edges. Different LETd-boosting strategies, such as Spot-scanning Hadron Arc (SHArc), could enhance LETd distribution by concentrating high-LETd values in potential hypoxic tumor cores while sparing organs at risk. PurposeThis study aims to investigate and verify different LETd-boosting strategies using an anthropomorphic pancreas phantom. MethodsVarious LETd-boosting strategies were investigated for a cylindrical and a pancreas-shaped target in an anthropomorphic pancreas phantom. Treatment plans were optimized using single field optimization (SFO) or multi field optimization (MFO), with objective functions based on either physical dose (Phys), relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose, or a combination of RBE and LETd-based objectives (LETopt). The LETd-boosting planning strategies were optimized with the goal of increasing the minimum LETd in the tumor without compromising its homogeneous dose coverage. Beam configurations investigated included the two-beam in-house clinical standard (2-SFOPhys, 2-SFORBE and 2-MFORBE-LETopt), a three-beam configuration (3-MFORBE and 3-MFORBE-LETopt) and SHArc (SHArcPhys, SHArcRBE and SHArcRBE-LETopt) using step-and-shoot delivery. The different plans were verified using an anthropomorphic pancreas phantom at HIT and compared to treatment planning system (TPS) predictions. ResultsAll investigated LETd-boosting strategies altered the LETd distribution while meeting optimization goals and constraints, resulting in varying degrees of LETd enhancement. For the cylindrical volume, the SHArc plan resulted in the highest LETd concentration in the tumor core, with the minimum LETd in the GTV scaling up to 91 keV/mu m. For the pancreas-shaped volume, however, the 3-MFORBE-LETopt achieved a higher minimum LETd in the GTV than SHArcRBE (75.6 and 62.3 keV/mu m, respectively). When combining SHArc with LETd optimization, a minimum LETd of 76.3 keV/mu m was achieved, suggesting a potential benefit from this combined approach. Most dosimetric verifications showed dose deviations to the TPS within a 5% range, for both beam-per-beam and total dose. LETd-optimized and SHArc plans exhibited slightly higher mean dose deviations (2.0%-4.6%) compared to the standard RBE-based plans (<1.5%). ConclusionThis study demonstrated the feasibility of enhancing LETd in pancreatic tumors using carbon ion arc delivery coupled with LETd optimization. The possibility of delivering these plans was verified through irradiation of an anthropomorphic pancreas phantom, which showed agreement between dose measurements and predictions.",0,,The article focuses on optimizing LETd distribution in carbon ion therapy without incorporating any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

The content talks about clinical practices, different beam configurations like SHArc, and optimization methods such as SFO or MFO with various objective functions. They mention verifying plans using a phantom and comparing to TPS predictions. Nowhere do they mention AI methods. It's more of a dosimetric study focusing on treatment planning strategies rather than applying AI techniques. So this doesn't fit the topic."

Methods: Eleven PC patients who underwent CBCT-guided online adaptive photon radiotherapy were selected. Data were imported into a CIRT treatment planning software to develop new plans for an ultra-hypofractionated CIRT protocol. Prescriptions and constraints were recalculated for a five-fraction schedule using a linear quadratic model for organs-at-risk (OARs) and targets, respectively. The biologically effective dose-equivalent prescribed dose was set at 43.2 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]). Each day, a synthetic CT (SCT) was generated from the planning CT (PCT) with the daily CBCT. A reference plan based on the PCT was compared to an adapted plan based on the SCT. Deformable image registration was used to allow summation of the daily doses. Results: The adapted plans met the clinical goals, whereas the reference plans exceeded the constraints in 27 % (stomach), 53 % (duodenum), and 31 % (small bowel) of the fractions. The adapted plans notably decreased V35.5 Gy[RBE] for all gastrointestinal OARs, while significantly enhancing the gross tumor volume (GTV) D95% and planning target volume (PTV) D90%. The accumulated doses showed significant improvements in the duodenum V35.5 Gy[RBE], GTV D95%, and PTV D90%. Conclusion: CBCT-guided adaptive CIRT for PC demonstrated favorable dosimetric results, notably enhancing the sparing of OARs and ensuring superior target coverage compared with non-adaptive CIRT protocols.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their application in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Methods and Materials: This analysis included patients with stage III NSCLC (n = 181) who received CIRT between December 2016 and June 2023. CIRT was administered at a relative biological effectiveness-weighted dose of 77 Gy (range, 69-83.6 Gy) in 22 fractions (Fx) (range, 19-24 Fx). Most patients (96.1%) underwent systemic therapy before and/or after CIRT. Toxicities and survival outcomes were recorded, and statistical analyses conducted. Results: The median follow-up period was 18.2 months. Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 acute toxicities were observed in 62.4%, 30.4%, 2.8%, and 0.6% of patients, respectively, with hematological toxicities accounting for all grade >= 3 acute toxicities. Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 late toxicities occurred in 40.3%, 30.9%, 4.4%, and 1.7% of patients, respectively, with most grade >= 3 CIRT-induced late toxicities (72.7%) observed in patients receiving a CIRT dose >= 79.2 Gy. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 37.1 and 16.7 months, respectively. The 2-year locoregional control, OS, PFS, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 66.1%, 64.2%, 40.3%, and 49.5%, respectively. Patients who received a CIRT dose <= 77 Gy had better OS (P = .047), but worse locoregional control compared with those who received higher doses (P = .026). Post-CIRT immunotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for improved OS, distant metastasis-free survival, and PFS (P = .002, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Conclusions: CIRT with pencil beam scanning was effective for locally advanced NSCLC, resulting in acceptable toxicities and promising OS outcomes, particularly with doses of 69 to 77 Gy and post-CIRT immunotherapy.

rayyan-283077625,Preoperative chemo-CIRT in Re/BRe pancreatic cancer: Insights from a multicenter prospective phase II clinical study (NCT03822936),"Purpose: There is debate about the optimal management of borderline resectable (bRe) and resectable (Re) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Both preclinical and clinical evidence showed that carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) produces superior control on radioresistant histologies compared to conventional photon beam radiotherapy (RT). However, so far there is a lack of data concerning the integration of CIRT in a multimodal approach with chemotherapy and surgery for bRe/Re.        Methods: We recently presented the first analysis of a multicenter prospective phase II clinical study aimed at assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of a neoadjuvant chemotherapy + short course of CIRT followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of bRe/Re PDAC. The study was terminated early due to low patient enrollment.Herein, we reported a post-hoc analysis focusing on toxicity, dosimetry and translational assessment.        Results: In our experience, CIRT can be integrated into a multimodal treatment strategy for bRe/Re PDAC, alongside chemotherapy and surgery. A case of fatal liver failure occurring three months post-surgery has been documented, likely related to the combination approach. Although the treatment plans were satisfactory according to the Local Effect Model (LEM) model, recalculations using the modified Microdosimetric Kinetic Model (mMKM) revealed suboptimal target coverage. Additionally, we observed an increased expression of PD-L1 following CIRT.        Conclusions: This multimodal approach was well tolerated; however, clinicians should carefully monitor for vascular disorders during follow-up and further investigate surgical techniques after CIRT. The increased PD-L1 expression supports the immunogenic effects of particle therapy and lays the groundwork for future studies. To enhance the therapeutic ratio of CIRT treatments, integrating LET-d based objectives into the plan optimization process should be considered.

Several detection approaches have been researched and developed, and many studies on prompt-gamma imaging have been conducted on its feasibility, detection systems optimisation, and possible workflows. Now, this form of particle therapy monitoring is finally arriving in clinical settings and showing impressive results. Prompt-gamma imaging may be the key to enabling crucial improvements in particle therapy, namely when considering more complex workflow scenarios, like adaptive radiotherapy using ion beams. Herein, several aspects related to prompt-gamma imaging are introduced, covering both its advantages and limitations. The need for particle therapy monitoring, the different prompt-gamma radiation detection systems, the difficulties with dealing with low emission yields and with the tools used to simulate it, the prediction tools for prompt-gamma radiation, and the translation into clinical applications are presented and discussed.

rayyan-283077627,Magnetic design of downstream scanning magnets for a novel hadrontherapy gantry,"Hadrontherapy utilizes accelerated ion beams to deliver precise and effective cancer treatments, depositing energy at specific depths while sparing healthy tissues. Gantries are large rotating structures that direct beams at various angles around the patient, improving dose conformity to tumors and the robustness of the treatment plan while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding organs. While proton gantries are widespread and commercially available, the diffusion of carbon ion gantries is limited due to more demanding technological challenges and financial investments. This paper presents the magnetic design of the scanning magnets for the EuroSIG (European Superconducting Ion Gantry) project, aimed at developing a novel superconducting gantry for hadrontherapy. The chosen layout foresees the positioning of the scanning magnets downstream of the last bending section. This simplifies the production of the superconducting dipole but increases the complexity of the scanning system in terms of integrated fields, bending angles, and ramp rates. To address this challenge, analytical models and optimization tools were employed to achieve balanced configurations for the scanning magnets, improving compatibility with power converters. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were implemented to evaluate and improve the steady-state field quality of horizontal and vertical scanning magnets. Particle tracking was used to validate the effective beam deflection in both magnets and assess beam position errors at the isocenter. Furthermore, quasistatic simulations were carried out to evaluate integral field errors due to the hysteretic behavior of the yoke alloy. Continuing the analysis of dynamic phenomena, the generation of eddy currents in the laminated yoke was investigated, highlighting the delay of the generated field with respect to the imposed current profile. The studies reported in this manuscript confirmed the design's feasibility, posing a solid base for the construction of the first scanning magnet prototype.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their applications in carbon ion therapy; it focuses on magnetic design and simulation techniques.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-283077628,Perfluorobutane Nanodroplets for the Selective Sensing and Range Verification of Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy: In Vitro Evaluation on Cells,"Range verification procedures are crucial in carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) to avoid undesired exposure while harnessing the superior features in dose-depth distribution that allow for better biological effectiveness than other adopted radiotherapies. Recently, we have proposed an innovative approach to dosimetry and uncertainties measurement in CIRT by upgrading phase-change ultrasound contrast agents to function as injectable tracers for ionizing particle beams. We developed a stable formulation of superheated nanodroplets (NDs) made of a liquid perfluorobutane core encapsulated within a cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) shell. The core vaporization is triggered by the high-linear energy transfer (LET) carbon ions at the Bragg peak, generating echogenic microbubbles, whereby the resulting echo-contrast relates to beam range with submillimeter precision. So far, in vitro experiments revealed the dependence of the NDs' response to carbon-ion radiation on their size, concentration, as well as particle fluence, which is associated with CIRT dose and beam energy. In this study, we further investigate the biological effect of carbon-ion radiation, before and after the Bragg peak, in 2D cell layer system and correlate this effect with the NDs' radiation response. We evaluated the interaction of nanodroplets of various sizes with the V-79 cell line, a well-established radiobiological model. Tissue-mimicking phantoms containing NDs, along with untreated cells and cells treated with size-sorted NDs, were exposed to C-ion doses of 4 and 8 Gy (130 mm, E = 257.5 MeV/u) at 37 degrees C. Results indicated that nanodroplets show affinity for the cells and good biocompatibility after incubation. Ultrasound image processing of the vaporization range of nanodroplets, triggered by the carbon-ion radiation, reveals a strong correlation with the cell mortality at the Bragg peak, as assessed by Crystal Violet staining. Our findings highlight the potential of nanodroplets as an injectable and noninvasive dosimeter from the perspective of real-time range verification, offering the ability to optimize treatment plans.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications in carbon-ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-283077630,Potential role of solid lipid curcumin particle (SLCP) as estrogen replacement therapy in mitigating TDP-43-related neuropathy in the mouse model of ALS disease,"Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was first identified in 1869, but it wasn't until the 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge that widespread attention was drawn to the disease. Since then, substantial research has been dedicated to developing treatments for ALS. Despite this, only three drugs - riluzole, edaravone and AMX0035, have been approved for clinical use, and they can only temporarily alleviate mild symptoms without significant disease modification or cure. Therefore, there remains a critical unmet need to identify disease modifying or curative therapies for ALS. The higher incidence and more severe progression of ALS and FTLD (frontotemporal lobar degeneration) observed in men and postmenopausal woman compared to young women suggests that sex hormones may significantly influence disease onset and progression. In both animal models and human clinical studies, 17 beta estradiol (E2) has been shown to delay and improve the outcomes of many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we examined the role of TDP-43 in the regulation of estrogen-related enzymes, CYP19A1 and CYP3A4. In addition, we examined the impact of curcumin on the regulation of estrogen E2 levels and TDP-43associated neuropathy as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of FTLD and ALS. Methods: Prp-TDP-43A315T mice was used as a model of ALS/FTLD to examine the expression patterns of E2 and its biosynthesis and degradation enzymes, CYP19A1 and CYP3A4. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms and the potency of solid lipid curcumin particles (SLCP) as an E2 replacement therapy for TDP-43 associated neuropathy was analyzed. We further examined the survival rates and the pathological TDP43 patterns in female and male Prp-TDP-43A315T mice administrated with or without SLCP. In addition, the changed expression levels of enzymes corresponding to E2 biosynthesis and degradation in the spinal cord of female and male Prp-TDP-43A315T mice with or without SLCP were determined. Results: We found that in addition to E2, the expression patterns of CYP19A1 and CYP3A4 proteins differed between Prp-TDP-43A315T mice compared to wild-type control, suggesting that toxic phosphorylated TDP43 oligomers may disrupt the balance between CYP19A1 and CYP3A4 expression, leading to reduced estrogen biosynthesis and accelerated degradation. In addition, we found that oral administration of SLCP prolonged the survival rates in female Prp-TDP-43A315T mice and significantly reduced the pathological insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 species. Furthermore, SLCP attenuated disease progression associated with TDP-43-related neuropathies through modulating estrogen biosynthesis and the activity of CYP450 enzymes. Conclusions: Our results showed that Prp-TDP-43A315T mice exhibit altered estradiol levels. Moreover, we demonstrated the efficacy of SLCP as an estrogen replacement therapy in mitigating TDP-43-associated disease progression and pathogenesis. These findings suggest that SLCP could be a promising strategy to induce E2 expression for the treatment of ALS and FTLD.",0,[],The article does not discuss any AI methods or applications and is unrelated to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Methods and Materials: The Particle Therapy Cooperative Group Skull Base/Central nervous system/Sarcoma Subcommittee consisting of radiation oncologists and medical physicists with specific fi c expertise in spinal irradiation developed expert recommendations discussing treatment planning considerations and current approaches in the treatment of primary spinal tumors. Results: Computed tomography simulation: factors that require significant fi cant consideration include (1) patient comfort, (2) setup reproducibility and stability, and (3) accessibility of appropriate beam angles. Spine Stabilization Hardware: If present, hardware should be placed with cross-links well above/below the level of the primary tumor to reduce the metal burden at the level of the tumor bed. New materials that can reduce uncertainties include poly- ether-ether-ketone and composite polyether-ether-ketone-carbon fi ber implants. Field Arrangement: Appropriate beam selection is required to ensure robust target coverage and organ at risk sparing. Commonly, 2 to 4 treatment fi elds, typically from posterior and/or posterior-oblique directions, are used. Treatment Planning Methodology: Robust optimization is recommended for all pencil beam scanning plans (the preferred treatment modality) and should consider setup uncertainty (between 3 and 7 mm) and range uncertainty (3%-3.5%). In the presence of metal hardware, use of an increased range uncertainty up to 5% is recommended.

rayyan-283077632,Proton Beam Therapy for Pancreatic Tumors A Consensus Statement from the Particle Therapy Cooperative Group Gastrointestinal Subcommittee,"Radiation therapy manages pancreatic cancer in various settings; however, the proximity of gastrointestinal (GI) luminal organs at risk (OARs) poses challenges to conventional radiation therapy. Proton beam therapy (PBT) may reduce toxicities compared to photon therapy. This consensus statement summarizes PBT's safe and optimal delivery for pancreatic tumors. Our group has specific expertise using PBT for GI indications and has developed expert recommendations for treating pancreatic tumors with PBT. Computed tomography (CT) simulation: Patients should be simulated supine (arms above head) with custom upper body immobilization. For stomach/duodenum filling consistency, patients should restrict oral intake within 3 hours before simulation/treatments. Fiducial markers may be implanted for image guidance; however, their design and composition require scrutiny. The reconstruction field-of-view should encompass all immobilization devices at the target level (CT slice thickness 2-3 mm). Four-dimensional CT should quantify respiratory motion and guide motion mitigation. Respiratory gating is recommended when motion affects OAR sparing or reduces target coverage. Treatment planning: Beam-angle selection factors include priority OAR-dose minimization, water-equivalent-thickness stability along the beam path, and enhanced relative biological effect consideration due to the increased linear energy transfer at the proton beam end-of-range. Posterior and right-lateral beam angles that avoid traversing GI luminal structures are preferred (minimizing dosimetric impacts of variable anatomies). Pencil beam scanning techniques should use robust optimization. Single-field optimization is preferable to increase robustness, but if OAR constraints cannot be met, multifield optimization may be used. Treatment delivery: Volumetric image guidance should be used daily. CT scans should be acquired ad hoc as necessary (at minimum every other week) to assess the dosimetric impacts of anatomy changes. Adaptive replanning should be performed as required. Our group has developed recommendations for delivering PBT to safely and effectively manage pancreatic tumors. (c) 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 785 high-risk PCa patients treated with CIRT and ADT. Based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model, two nomograms predicting 5- and 7-year BCR-free survival were developed and internally validated.

Nomograms are predictive models, often built with statistical or machine learning methods, which can be considered AI. So this article does apply AI (specifically LASSO) to improve outcomes prediction in carbon ion therapy. Therefore, it should be selected."

Through animal experimentation, we have revealed that in a titanium particle-induced osteolysis rat model, rESWT intervention significantly increased periprosthetic bone density compared to untreated controls, concurrently reducing osteolytic lesion area and lowering serum IL-1 beta levels. Histological analyses demonstrated a relative decrease in osteoclast counts within the treatment group versus non-treated controls. These findings indicate that rESWT, through mechanisms involving anti-inflammatory actions and suppression of osteoclastogenesis, may serve as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for preventing and managing periprosthetic bone loss, demonstrating clinical potential to delay or eliminate the necessity for revision surgeries.",0,,The study focuses on radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy for bone loss around prostheses and does not involve any applications of AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The title mentions an experimental study of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) for periprosthetic osteolysis caused by wear particles. From the content, they used animal models to test rESWT and found that it increased bone density, reduced osteolytic lesions, and had anti-inflammatory effects. They also looked at histological analyses showing fewer osteoclasts in treated rats compared to controls. The conclusion suggests that rESWT could be a non-invasive treatment for preventing bone loss around prostheses, potentially reducing the need for revision surgeries. Now, I need to see if this relates to AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy used in cancer treatment, and AI might be applied in areas like treatment planning, dose optimization, or patient-specific protocols.

Methods: In this work, we extend a previously published method for neutron capture detection and discrimination. A Geant4 Monte Carlo model was designed, with the simulated irradiation of a poly(methyl methacrylate) phantom and cubic 10 B insert with carbon and helium ion beams and various shielding configurations. Results: In the free-space configuration, shielding the crystal actually decreases the ratio of true/false positive detections (RTF) by more than 50% and increases the activation of the detector. Ina closed-space configuration with a model of the beamline neutron fluence, R TF also decreases with shielding, although activation decreases in this case. However, fora detector with boron present in the printed circuit boards (PCBs), shielding with a thin layer of Gd2O3 improves R TF by up to 21%. Conclusions: Shielding of the detector crystal itself is unnecessary as shielding actually degrades discrimination accuracy relative to the unshielded detector. However, if the detector PCBs contain boron, then shielding the electronics provides a valuable increase in overall detector selectivity.",0,[],The study focuses on shielding strategies and detection optimization in neutron capture enhanced particle therapy using Monte Carlo simulations but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The title mentions an exploratory study of shielding strategies for boron neutron capture discrimination in 10B Neutron Capture Enhanced Particle Therapy (NCEPT). Hmm, that sounds a bit technical but not immediately related to AI or carbon ion therapy. The purpose is about evaluating shielding strategies on false positive detections by a simulated detector. They used Geant4 Monte Carlo modeling with poly(methyl methacrylate) phantom and cubic 10B insert, irradiated with carbon and helium ion beams. So they're using different shielding configurations to see how it affects the detection rates. The results show that shielding can either decrease or improve the true/false positive ratio depending on the setup. They conclude that shielding the detector itself isn't necessary but if the PCBs have boron, then shielding helps. Now, looking at the topic again: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. This article doesn't mention anything about artificial intelligence methods like machine learning, neural networks, or any other AI techniques. It's more focused on physics-based simulations and shielding strategies. The methods used are Monte Carlo modeling with Geant4, which is a simulation tool but not an AI method.

Enhancing the delivery efficiency of photosensitizers and elevating oxygen levels at the lesion site are two established strategies for improving its effectiveness. Here, we introduce a strategy involving the release of pressurized oxygen to drive photosensitizer diffusion, which is incorporated into a core-shell microneedle (MN) system to improve PDT. This MN system comprises a polyvinylpyrrolidone shell and methylene blue (MB) photosensitizer loaded core particles containing pressurized oxygen bubbles. Upon insertion, the aqueous tissue environment triggers the dissolution of particles within the MNs, enabling the rapid release of oxygen, thereby promoting the diffusion of MB. In vitro experiments demonstrate that these particles could effectively accelerate the release and diffusion of MB. The released oxygen could relieve hypoxia and increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of PDT. In a mouse melanoma model, the MN system enhances tumor growth inhibition induced by PDT and mitigates tumor metastasis. This innovative system offers an autonomous, safe, and convenient approach for localized gas delivery and drug diffusion, potentially creating new avenues for efficiently combining gas and other therapies for superficial diseases.",0,,The article focuses on improving photodynamic therapy using microneedles and oxygen delivery but does not discuss any applications of AI in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

However, the identification of target molecules over-expressed in a wide range of tumors remains a significant challenge. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of cell membrane-exposed heat shock protein 70 kDa (mHSP70) on different tumor cells and to develop a nanoscale delivery system based on a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes mHSP70 and uses chitosan core-shell nanoparticles (NPs). Several types of tumor cells (breast, pancreas, colon, prostate cancers, and some lymphomas) expressed mHSP70 as was determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy both in 2D and 3D cultures. Core NPs were formed by chitosan (C) conjugated to allocolchicinoid, which was used as a model drug (D). mAbs (A) targeting mHSP70 were complexed with succinylchitosan and used as NP shells forming final CAD-NPs. These NPs were characterized by size, charge, and functional activity. CAD-NPs were shown to have additional toxicity in comparison with CD-NPs in mHSP7-positive cells.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes of PT and photon radiotherapy in treating EHC. Medline/PubMed and Japan Medical Abstracts databases were screened using a systematic search strategy. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), pooled using a random effects model. Results: In total, 236 articles were retrieved. After screening, 11 articles were retained, comprising 2108 patients (nine photon articles, n = 2038 patients; two PT articles, n = 70 patients). We have updated and incorporated the outcomes of the prospective data registry (Proton-net, n = 137 patients) for PT. The 1-year OS probability rates were 56% (95% confidence interval = 49%-62%) for the photon and 72% (65%-78%) for the PT groups (p < 0.001). The median survival time was 13.1 months (11.0-15.1 months) for the photon group and 18.8 months (14.1-23.4 months) for the PT group (p = 0.03). The PT group demonstrated a superior OS rate compared to that observed in the photon group. The incidence rates of grade 3 <= toxicity was 18.5%-33% in the photon radiotherapy group and 2.9%-15% in the PT group.

Despite advancements in treatment, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, and effective therapies are still lacking. Methods In this study, we investigated the effects of titanium particles on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results Our findings revealed that titanium particles not only promote the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts and enhance the secretion of inflammatory factors but also inhibit the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts and reduce the expression of Wnt signaling pathway-related factors. Furthermore, using a mouse model of knee prosthesis loosening and AAV-mediated gene therapy, we demonstrated that the combination of TNF-alpha interference and Wnt3a overexpression was more effective than single-gene therapy in reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, promoting bone formation, and mitigating bone destruction. Conclusions These results highlight the dual role of titanium particles in periprosthetic osteolysis and underscore the potential of a gene therapy strategy targeting both inflammatory factors and the Wnt signaling pathway to improve knee prosthesis loosening.

In this study, we established a mouse model of prosthetic loosening and evaluated the therapeutic effects of targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A (Wnt3a) on osteolysis. TNF-alpha knockdown reduced inflammation and osteoclast-related gene expression, while Wnt3a overexpression increased osteoblast-related gene expression. Notably, the combination of these interventions showed superior efficacy in inhibiting osteolysis compared to monotherapy. Biomechanical imaging and histological staining revealed that combined therapy enhanced bone density and minimized the gaps between the peri-prosthetic bone and the prosthesis, reducing fibrous connective tissue proliferation. Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy was found to be safe, with no adverse effects observed in liver, brain, spleen, and kidney tissues. Our findings suggest that combining TNF-alpha silencing with Wnt3a overexpression may be a promising approach for treating particle-induced peri-implant osteolysis and warrants further clinical investigation.",0,,The study focuses on gene therapy strategies targeting TNF-alpha and Wnt3a for treating periprosthetic osteolysis and does not involve any applications of AI in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Materials and Methods: Using 2 different DIR algorithms, ANAtomically CONstrained Deformation Algorithm (ANACONDA), the DIR algorithm incorporated in RayStation, and Elastix, an open-source registration software, we retrospectively assessed the quality of the deformed CT (dCT) generation in the pelvic region for 5 patients. T1- and T2-weighted daily control MRI acquired prior to treatment delivery were used for the DIR. We compared the contours automatically mapped on the dCT against the manual contours on the MRI (ground truth) by calculating the Dice similarity coefficients and mean distances to the agreement for organs at risk, targets, and outer contour. We assessed the dosimetric impact of the DIR on the clinical treatment plans, comparing the dosevolume histograms and the value of the clinical goals achieved for each dCT. The water equivalent path lengths and dose range 80% (R80%) maps were compared by casting on the beams' eye view. Results: The T1 sequences performed better for the DIR with ANACONDA compared against the T2. ANACONDA's performance agreed with Elastix. The bladder and rectum led to the worst agreement. For the remaining structures analyzed, Dice similarity coefficients above 0.80 were obtained. Maximum median deviations of 7.1 and 2.1 mm were observed for water equivalent path lengths and R80%, respectively, on the PTV. Conclusion: This work shows a good agreement on the DIR quality achieved with ANACONDA for the structures in the beams' path.

The potential differences in MRI alterations after proton and photon RT, has raised concerns regarding the relative biological effectiveness of proton therapy. To provide an overview of MRI alterations in the brain post-RT and to explore differences between photon and proton RT, a systematic review adhering to the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on the assessment methods and definitions across studies. A systematic search of three electronic databases was performed using the concepts 'normo-fractionated radiotherapy ', 'MRI alterations' and 'brain, skull base or head and neck tumours in adult and paediatric populations'. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed on articles meeting the predefined criteria by two independent reviewers. Out of 5887 screened studies, 94 met the inclusion criteria. These studies were categorized based on confinement of the MRI alterations to temporal lobe, brainstem, or across the entire brain. Additional subclassification was performed based on MRI sequences evaluated or by the nature of the alterations, with pseudoprogression generally reserved for glioma patients.

DENV vaccine efficacy varies depending on the vaccine type, the circulating serotype, and vaccine coverage. We investigated defective interfering particles (DIPs) and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver DI290, an anti-DENV DI RNA. Both DIPs and DI290-loaded LNPs (LNP-290) effectively suppressed DENV infection in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), THP-1 macrophages, and fibroblasts-natural DENV targets. Inhibiting interferon (IFN) signaling with a Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor or an IFN-c/13 receptor 1 (IFNAR1)binding antibody blocked DIP and LNP-290 antiviral activity. LNP-290 demonstrated a greater than log10 inhibition of DENV viral loads in IFNAR-deficient (Ifnar-/-) and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and 7 double knockout (Irf3/7-/-) mice. Pathway analysis of RNA sequencing data from LNP-treated C57BL/6J mice, Ifnar-/- mice, and human MDMs treated with LNPs or DENV DIPs indicated DI290 treatment enhanced IFN responses, suggesting IFN-A and IFN-y provided antiviral activity when IFN-c/13 responses were diminished.

PTT is an attractive therapy for highly metastatic tumors-such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-because PTT is a potent activator of immunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD is characterized by the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that help the immune system recognize cancer cells as ""nonself."" This generates an immune response against the tumor cells and helps to combat both primary and metastatic tumors. However, an unknown thermal window remains in which ICD is most prevalent. Here, we conjugate an NIR-absorbing dye to the surface of bacteriophage Q beta to generate a viral-based PTA. Additionally, we demonstrate that mild PTT (<45 degrees C) is not enough to cause significant apoptosis in the murine TNBC model. In comparison, hot PTT (>60 degrees C) effectively eliminates cancer cells but is less likely to induce ICD.

The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract again carefully to understand what the article is about. The title mentions optimization of immunogenic cell death in triple-negative breast cancer using virus-like particle-based photothermal therapy. Hmm, photothermal therapy (PTT) uses near-infrared light and a photothermal agent to generate heat to kill tumor cells. They're looking at how this affects ICD, which involves damage-associated molecular patterns that help the immune system recognize cancer cells as nonself. The study seems to focus on finding the optimal temperature range for PTT to effectively induce cell death while also promoting an immune response against the tumors. They tested different temperatures and found that moderate PTT (50-60 degrees C) was most effective in killing cells and inducing ICD, which led to increased DAMPs and a better cytokine ratio from dendritic cells. Now, looking at the topic again: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of X-rays or protons. It's known for its high precision and effectiveness in treating certain cancers. The article I'm reviewing doesn't mention anything about AI methods or techniques. It's purely focused on photothermal therapy, the thermal effects on cancer cells, and immune responses. There's no discussion of machine learning, algorithms, data analysis, or any other AI-related tools being applied to improve carbon ion therapy. Since the topic is specifically about how AI is used in carbon ion therapy, this article doesn't fit because it doesn't discuss AI at all. It's more about optimizing a different type of cancer treatment (PTT) and understanding its biological effects.

This emphasizes the need for comprehensive studies to understand better and define specific particle therapy facilities' staffing requirements. In a 2022 survey of 25 particle therapy facilities in Japan with an 84% response rate, significant insights were obtained regarding workload distribution, defined as the product of personnel count and task time (person-minutes), for patient-related tasks and equipment quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). The survey revealed that machinery QA/QC tasks were particularly demanding, with an average monthly workload of 376.9 min and weekly tasks averaging 162.1 min. In comparison, patient-related workloads focused on treatment planning, exhibiting substantial time commitments, particularly for scanning and passive scattering techniques. The average workloads for treatment planning per patient were 291.3 and 195.4 min, respectively. In addition, specific patient scenarios such as pre-treatment sedation in pediatric cases require longer durations (averaging 84.5 min), which likely include the workloads of not only the physician responsible for sedation but also the radiotherapy technology and medical physics specialists providing support during sedation and the nursing staff involved in sedation care. These findings underscore the significant time investments required for machinery QA/QC and patient-specific treatment planning in particle therapy facilities, along with the need for specialized care procedures in pediatric cases.

This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study which compared the clinical outcomes of patients with pelvic bone sarcoma who underwent surgical treatment and particle beam therapy in Japan. Methods: A total of 116 patients with pelvic bone sarcoma treated at 19 specialized sarcoma centers in Japan were included in this study. Fifty-seven patients underwent surgery (surgery group), and 59 patients underwent particle beam therapy (particle beam group; carbon-ion radiotherapy: 55 patients, proton: four patients). Results: The median age at primary tumor diagnosis was 52 years in the surgery group and 66 years in the particle beam group (P < 0.001), and the median tumor size was 9 cm in the surgery group and 8 cm in the particle beam group (P = 0.091). Overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared among 116 patients with bone sarcoma (surgery group, 57 patients; particle beam group, 59 patients). After propensity score matching, the 3-year OS, LC, and MFS rates were 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.5-93.2%), 66.0% (95% CI, 43.3-81.3%), and 78.4% (95% CI, 55.5-90.5%), respectively, in the surgery group and 64.9% (95% CI, 41.7-80.8%), 86.4% (95% CI, 63.3-95.4%), and 62.6% (95% CI, 38.5-79.4%), respectively, in the particle beam group. In chordoma patients, only surgery was significantly correlated with worse LC in the univariate analysis. Conclusions: The groups had no significant differences in the OS, LC, and MFS rates. Among the patients with chordomas, the 3-year LC rate in the particle beam group was significantly higher than in the surgery group. (c) 2024 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.

Material and methods: For realization of MR-guided photon and particle therapy (MRgRT/MRgPT), a 1.5 T MR scanner was installed at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center. To integrate MRI into the treatment process, a flat tabletop and dedicated coil holders for flex coils were used, which prevent deformation of the patient external contour and allow for the use of immobilization tools for reproducible positioning. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was compared for the diagnostic and therapy-specific setup using the flat couch top and flexible coils for the a) head & neck and b) abdominal region as well as for different bandwidths and clinical pulse sequences. Additionally, a quality assurance (QA) protocol with monthly measurements of the ACR phantom and measurement of geometric distortions for a large field-of-view (FOV) was implemented to assess the imaging quality parameters of the device over the course of 20 months. Results: The SNR measurements showed a decreased SNR for the RT-specific as compared to the diagnostic setup of (a) 26% to 34% and (b) 11% to 33%.

rayyan-283077654,Development of a bacteria-nanosapper for the active delivery of ZIF-8 particles containing therapeutic genes for cancer immune therapy,"Specific tumor-targeted gene delivery remains an unsolved therapeutic issue due to aberrant vascularization in tumor microenvironment (TME). Some bacteria exhibit spontaneous chemotaxis toward the anaerobic and immune-suppressive TME, which makes them ideal natural vehicles for cancer gene therapy. Here, we conjugated ZIF-8 metal-organic frameworks encapsulating eukaryotic murine interleukin 2 (Il2) expression plasmid onto the surface of VNP20009, an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain with well-documented anti-cancer activity, and constructed a TME-targeted Il2 delivery system named Il2/ZIF-8@Salmonella. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Il2/ZIF-8@Salmonella maintained the tumor-targeting feature of bacteria, and could be effectively phagocytosed by intratumoral macrophages, thus leading to the expression and secretion of IL2 in TME. The detailed analysis of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) showed that one dose of combinatorial Il2/ZIF8@Salmonella achieved synergistic actions on a potent remodeling of TIME, marked by the activation of cytotoxic T cells and M1-polarization of macrophages in TME, thus leading to significant antitumor effects in melanoma, orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma, and pulmonary metastasis models. More importantly, Il2/ZIF-8@Salmonella exhibited high safety to major organs and hematopoietic systems. Taken together, we report a novel plasmid/ZIF-8@Salmonella system that simultaneously achieves effective TME-targeted delivery of therapeutic gene, as well as synergistic re-activation of TIME. <feminine ordinal indicator> 2024 The Authors.

rayyan-283077655,"Revolutionizing cancer treatment in India: Evaluating the unmet need, economics, and a roadmap for project implementation of particle therapy","Introduction: This study aims to quantitatively assess eligible patients and project the demand for particle therapy facilities in India from 2020 to 2040. In addition, an economic analysis evaluates the financial feasibility of implementing this technology. The study also examines the prospective benefits and challenges of adopting this technology in India. Methodology: Cancer incidence and projected trends were analyzed for pediatric patients using the Global Childhood Cancer microsimulation model and adult patients using the Globocan data. Economic cost evaluation is performed for large-scale combined particle (carbon and proton-three room fixed-beam), large-scale proton (one gantry and two fixed-beam), and small-scale proton (one gantry) facility. Results: By 2040, the estimated number of eligible patients for particle therapy is projected to reach 161,000, including approximately 14,000 pediatric cases. The demand for particle therapy facilities is projected to rise from 81 to 97 in 2020 to 121 to 146 by 2040. The capital expenditure is estimated to be only 3.7 times that of a standard photon linear accelerator over a 30-year period. Notably, the treatment cost can be reduced to USD 400 to 800 per fraction, substantially lower than that in high-income countries (USD 1000 to 3000 per fraction). Conclusion: This study indicates that, in the Indian scenario, all particle therapy models are cost-beneficial and feasible, with large-scale proton therapy being the most suitable. Despite challenges such as limited resources, space, a skilled workforce, referral systems, and patient affordability, it offers substantial benefits. These include the potential to treat many patients and convenient construction and operational costs. An iterative phased implementation strategy can effectively overcome these challenges, paving the way for the successful adoption of particle therapy in India. Plain Language Summary: In India, the number of eligible patients benefiting from high-precision particle therapy technology is projected to rise till 2040. Despite high upfront costs, our study finds the long-term feasibility of all particle therapy models, potentially offering a substantial reduction in treatment cost compared to high-income countries.

rayyan-283077656,Robustness of carbon-ion radiotherapy against DNA damage repair associated radiosensitivity variation based on a biophysical model,"Background: Interpatient variation of tumor radiosensitivity is rarely considered during the treatment planning process despite its known significance for the therapeutic outcome. Purpose: To apply our mechanistic biophysical model to investigate the biological robustness of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) against DNA damage repair interference (DDRi) associated patient-to-patient variability in radiosensitivity and its potential clinical advantages against conventional radiotherapy approaches. Methods and Materials: The “UNIfied and VERSatile bio response Engine” (UNIVERSE) was extended by carbon ions and its predictions were compared to a panel of in vitro and in vivo data including various endpoints and DDRi settings within clinically relevant dose and linear energy transfer (LET) ranges. The implications of UNIVERSE predictions were then assessed in a clinical patient scenario considering DDRi variance. Results: UNIVERSE tests well against the applied benchmarks. While in vitro survival curves were predicted with an R2 > 0.92, deviations from in vivo RBE data were less than 5.6% The conducted paradigmatic patient plan study implies a markedly reduced significance of DDRi based radiosensitivity variability in CIRT (13% change of (Formula presented.) in target) compared to conventional radiotherapy (62%) and that boosting the LET within the target further amplifies this robustness of CIRT (8%). In the case of heightened tumor radiosensitivity, a dose de-escalation strategy for photons allows a reduction of the maximum effective dose within the normal tissue (NT) from a (Formula presented.) of 2.65 to 1.64 Gy, which lies below the level found for CIRT ((Formula presented.) = 2.41 Gy) for the analyzed plan and parameters. However, even after de-escalation, the integral effective dose in the NT is found to be substantially higher for conventional radiotherapy in comparison to CIRT ((Formula presented.) of 0.75, 0.46, and 0.24 Gy for the conventional plan, its de-escalation and CIRT, respectively). Conclusions: The framework offers adequate predictions of in vitro and in vivo radiation effects of CIRT while allowing the consideration of DRRi based solely on parameters derived from photon data. The results of the patient planning study underline the potential of CIRT to minimize important sources of interpatient divergence in therapy outcome, especially when combined with techniques that allow to maximize the LET within the tumor. Despite the potential of de-escalation strategies for conventional radiotherapy to reduce the maximum effective dose in the NT, CIRT appears to remain a more favorable option due to its ability to reduce the integral effective dose within the NT. © 2024 The Authors.

rayyan-283077659,Deep-learning synthetized 4DCT from 4DMRI of the abdominal site in carbon-ion radiotherapy,"Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of deep-learning-based synthetic 4DCT (4D-sCT) generation from 4DMRI data of abdominal patients undergoing Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT). Material and methods: A 3-channel conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) was trained and tested on twenty-six patients, using paired T1-weighted 4DMRI and 4DCT volumes. 4D-sCT data were generated via the cGAN following a 3-channels segmentation approach (air, bone, soft tissue) in two scenarios: (a) 4DCT-based approach (i.e. segmentation relying on 4DCT) and (b) 4DMRI-based approach (i.e. manual segmentation on 4DMRI, to simulate a 4DMRI-only scenario). The network was first validated on a 4D computational phantom, where a ground truth dataset was available. Subsequently, the network was tested on 6 independent held-out-of-training patients. Generated volumes were evaluated with respect to the original 4DCT based on motion analysis, similarity metrics (e.g. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Cross Coefficient (NCC)) and dosimetric criteria, by means of recalculating clinically optimized CIRT plans on the 4D-sCT. Results: For the phantom, similarity metrics were in line with literature results, while dose volume histogram values were below 0.9 %. 4DCT-based patient results demonstrated an accurate representation with respect to the original 4DCT images (MAE: 50.64–51.29 HU), while 4DMRI-only-based results yielded higher values (MAE: 81.15–90.22 HU). Gamma pass rates (3 %/3mm) were ∼ 97 % for the 4DCT-based scenario, showing dosimetric consistency between the compared 4DCT and 4D-sCT dose distributions. D95% values on GTV/CTV were within clinical tolerances for the 4DMRI-only scenario.

Purpose: To extend and validate the in-house developed fast MC dose engine MonteRay for carbon ion therapy, including physical and biological dose calculation. Methods: MonteRay is a CPU MC dose calculation engine written in C++ that is capable of simulating therapeutic proton, helium and carbon ion beams. In this work, development steps taken to include carbon ions in MonteRay are presented. Dose distributions computed with MonteRay are evaluated using a comprehensive validation dataset, including various measurements (pristine Bragg peaks, spread out Bragg peaks in water and behind an anthropomorphic phantom) and simulations of a patient plan. The latter includes both physical and biological dose comparisons. Runtimes of MonteRay were evaluated against those of FLUKA MC on a standard benchmark problem. Results: Dosimetric comparisons between MonteRay and measurements demonstrated good agreement. In terms of pristine Bragg peaks, mean errors between simulated and measured integral depth dose distributions were between −2.3% and +2.7%. Comparing SOBPs at 5, 12.5 and 20 cm depth, mean absolute relative dose differences were 0.9%, 0.7% and 1.6% respectively. Comparison against measurements behind an anthropomorphic head phantom revealed mean absolute dose differences of (Formula presented.) with global 3%/3 mm 3D-γ passing rates of 99.3%, comparable to those previously reached with FLUKA (98.9%). Comparisons against dose predictions computed with the clinical treatment planning tool RayStation 11B for a meningioma patient plan revealed excellent local 1%/1 mm 3D-γ passing rates of 98% for physical and 94% for biological dose. In terms of runtime, MonteRay achieved speedups against reference FLUKA simulations ranging from 14× to 72×, depending on the beam's energy and the step size chosen.

The effect of those novel approaches on the clinical dose and LET distributions was investigated. Materials and Methods: The effect of the NIC and trichrome algorithm was assessed, creating single beam plans for a virtual water phantom with standard settings and NIC + trichrome corrections. Reference DRBE and LETd distributions were simulated using FLUKA version 2021.2.9. Thirty clinically applied scanned carbon ion treatment plans were recalculated applying NIC, trichrome and NIC + trichrome corrections, using the LEM low dose approximation and compared to clinical plans (base RS). Four treatment sites were analysed: six prostate adenocarcinoma, ten head and neck, nine locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and five sacral chordoma. The FLUKA and clinical plans were compared in terms of DRBE deviations for D98%, D50%, D2% for the clinical target volume (CTV) and D50% in ring-like dose regions retrieved from isodose curves in base RS plans. Additionally, region-based median LETd deviations and global gamma parameters were evaluated. Results: Dose deviations comparing base RS and evaluation plans were within ± 1% supported by γ-pass rates over 97% for all cases. No significant LETd deviations were reported in the CTV, but significant median LETd deviations were up to 80% for very low dose regions.

rayyan-283077665,High efficacy of particle beam therapies against tumors under hypoxia and prediction of the early stage treatment effect using 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography,"Objective: Compared with radiation therapy using photon beams, particle therapies, especially those using carbons, show a high relative biological effectiveness and low oxygen enhancement ratio. Using cells cultured under normoxic conditions, our group reported a greater suppressive effect on cell growth by carbon beams than X-rays, and the subsequent therapeutic effect can be predicted by the cell uptake amount of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) the day after treatment. On the other hand, a hypoxic environment forms locally around solid tumors, influencing the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy. In this study, the influence of tumor hypoxia on particle therapies and the ability to predict the therapeutic effect using 18F-FLT were evaluated. Methods: Using a murine colon carcinoma cell line (colon 26) cultured under hypoxic conditions (1.0% O2 and 5.0% CO2), the suppressive effect on cell growth by X-ray, proton, and carbon irradiation was evaluated. In addition, the correlation between decreased 18F-FLT uptake after irradiation and subsequent suppression of cell proliferation was investigated. Results: Tumor cell growth was suppressed most efficiently by carbon-beam irradiation. 18F-FLT uptake temporarily increased the day after irradiation, especially in the low-dose irradiation groups, but then decreased from 50 h after irradiation, which is well correlated with the subsequent suppression on tumor cell growth. Conclusions: Carbon beam treatment shows a strong therapeutic effect against cells under hypoxia. Unlike normoxic tumors, it is desirable to perform 18F-FLT positron emission tomography 2–3 days after irradiation for early prediction of the treatment effect.

Approach. A meta-analysis of published clinical data of 233 NSCLC patients treated by carbon-ion radiotherapy under 18-, 9-, 4-, and single-fraction schedules was conducted. The linear-quadratic (LQ)-based cell-survival model incorporating the radiobiological 5Rs, radiosensitivity, repopulation, repair, redistribution, and reoxygenation, was developed to reproduce the clinical TCP data. Redistribution and reoxygenation were regarded together as a single phenomenon and termed ‘resensitization’ in the model. The optimum interval time between fractions was investigated for each fraction schedule using the determined model parameters. Main results. The clinical TCP data for 18-, 9-, and 4-fraction schedules were reasonably reproduced by the model without the resensitization effect, whereas its incorporation was essential to reproduce the TCP data for all fraction schedules including the single fraction. The curative dose for the single-fraction schedule was estimated to be 49.0 Gy (RBE), which corresponds to the clinically adopted dose prescription of 50.0 Gy (RBE). For 18-, 9-, and 4-fraction schedules, a 2-to-3-day interval is required to maximize the resensitization effect during the time interval. In contrast, the single-fraction schedule cannot benefit from the resensitization effect, and the shorter treatment time is preferable to reduce the effect of sub-lethal damage repair during the treatment. Significance. The LQ-based cell-survival model incorporating the radiobiological 5Rs was developed and used to evaluate the effect of the resensitization on clinical results of NSCLC patients treated with hypo-fractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy. The incorporation of the resensitization into the cell-survival model improves the reproducibility to the clinical TCP data. A shorter treatment time is preferable in the single-fraction schedule, while a 2-to-3-day interval between fractions is preferable in the multi-fraction schedules for effective treatments. © 2024 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",0,,The study does not involve any AI methods but focuses on a radiobiological model to evaluate resensitization effects in carbon-ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

First, the title mentions modeling of resensitization effect on carbon-ion therapy. That's within the scope of carbon ion therapy applications. Now, looking at the content: they conducted a meta-analysis of clinical data and developed a cell-survival model using the linear-quadratic (LQ) approach incorporating 5Rs—radiosensitivity, repopulation, repair, redistribution, and reoxygenation. They termed redistribution and reoxygenation as 'resensitization'. The study evaluates how this resensitization affects tumor control probability across different fraction schedules. They found that including resensitization was essential for reproducing TCP data, especially for single-fraction treatments. The significance part mentions the model improves reproducibility of clinical results and discusses optimal treatment intervals based on their findings. Now, considering the topic is about AI applications in carbon ion therapy, I need to see if any AI methods are mentioned or used here. From the abstract, it seems they used a mathematical model (LQ-based) but there's no mention of machine learning, neural networks, or any other AI techniques.

rayyan-283077675,Cell survival prediction in carbon-ion radiotherapy based on DNA radiation damage characterization of mixed beam,"Objective To develop a prediction model for cell survival under radiation of mixed carbon ion beam based on DNA radiation damage simulation, and to assess the impacts of secondary particles on the cell survival prediction for regions beyond the Bragg peak. Methods First, the Monte Carlo Damage Simulation (MCDS) code was employed to construct a database of DNA double-strand break (DSB) damage induced by carbon ions and their primary secondary particles for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Subsequently, models for cell survival under irradiation of single type of particles were established through fitting and were validated based on the DSB damage database and the Particle Irradiation Data Ensemble (PIDE) experimental database of radiation biology for cells in vitro. Then, the TOPAS Monte Carlo code was used to simulate the depth-dose and energy spectrum distributions of 290 MeV/u clinical carbon ion beam. A dose-weighting method based on a precomputed DSB damage database for monoenergetic particles was proposed, and the impacts of secondary particles on cell survival prediction beyond the Bragg peak were assessed. Results The model established in this study accurately predicted the survival rates of CHO cells under different irradiation conditions. Concurrently, the dose-weighting method employed accurately characterized the radiation damage properties of mixed beams of carbon ions and their secondary particles. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of parameter α between the experimental values and model-derived predictions after irradiation using the H+, He2+, C6+, and Ne10+ beams were 0.139 2, 0.203 9, 0.192 0, and 0.516 9 Gy-1, respectively, while the RMSEs of parameter β were 0.020 5, 0.059 8, 0.040 5, and 0.060 5 Gy-2, respectively. The discrepancies between model-derived predictions and experimentally measured values of the survival rates of CHO cells at and beyond the Bragg peak after irradiation using 290 MeV/u carbon ion beam were 0.3%±0.24% and 2.3%±0.24%, respectively. Conclusions A prediction model for cell survival under irradiation of carbon ion beam based on DNA radiation damage simulation is developed in this study. By further considering the dose distributions of various secondary particles, the model can more accurately predict cell survival rates beyond the Bragg peak. This study is expected to provide a reference for accurately assessing the equivalent biological dose beyond the Bragg peak in carbon ion clinical radiotherapy. © 2024 Chinese Medical Association.",0,,The study does not explicitly explore or apply AI methods but focuses on computational modeling and simulation techniques for cell survival prediction in carbon-ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls under the topic of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

The methods section talks about Monte Carlo Damage Simulation (MCDS) and TOPAS Monte Carlo code, which are simulation tools but not necessarily AI methods. They used these codes to construct databases and models for predicting cell survival. There's mention of fitting models and validating them against experimental data, but again, this seems more like traditional computational modeling rather than AI techniques. The results show accurate predictions with low RMSE values, but the conclusion doesn't reference any AI applications either. It focuses on improving prediction accuracy by considering secondary particles' dose distributions. So, while it's related to carbon ion therapy and uses computational models, I don't see any indication that AI methods like machine learning or neural networks were employed here.

rayyan-283077680,Tumor volume instead of recurrent T category predicts clinical outcome of patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma salvaged by carbon ion radiation therapy,"Background: Although carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) substantially improves the overall survival (OS) of patients with LR-NPC, approximately 40% of the patients may develop local recurrence. The purpose of study is to assess the value of tumor volume (TV) as a predictive tool to guide individualized CIRT. Methods: Consecutive patients with LR-NPC treated using CIRT at Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center between April 2015 and May 2019 were included. TV before CIRT was delineated and calculated. The generalized additive Cox model was used to examine the relationship between TV and OS and local progression-free survival (LPFS). A cutoff value of tumor volume was identified to best discriminate patients with different 2-year OS rates, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: A total of 157 patients were enrolled. The median tumor volume was 22.49 (2.52–90.13) ml. In the univariable analyses, tumor volume was significantly associated with OS (p < 0.001) and LPFS (p = 0.01). The relationships with OS (p = 0.009) and LPFS (p = 0.020) remained significant in multivariable analyses. Using ROC analysis, a TV of 26.69 ml was identified to predict the 2-year OS rate. To facilitate potential clinical use, 25 ml was designated as the final cutoff value. The 2-year OS and LPFS rates were 88.6 % vs 62.3 %, and 54.7 % vs 35.5 %, for patients with a TV ≤ 25 ml and > 25 ml, respectively. Conclusion: Tumor volume could predict the OS and LPFS of patients. We propose that tumor volume should be considered in the risk stratification and CIRT-based treatment for patients with LR-NPC. © 2024",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications; it focuses on tumor volume as a predictive tool using traditional statistical analysis.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-283077687,Progress Toward TURBO: A Novel Beam Delivery System for Charged Particle Therapy,"TURBO – Technology for Ultra Rapid Beam Operation – is a novel beam delivery system (BDS) in development at the University of Melbourne. The BDS determines several aspects of treatment delivery where a key bottleneck is the deadtime associated with beam energy variation. Beamlines at treatment facilities have a ±1% momentum acceptance range, requiring all the magnetic fields to adjust to deliver different energy beams at multiple depths in the tumour volume. A BDS using Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFA) optics could reduce the energy layer switching time (ELST) by enabling the transport of a large range of beam energies within the same fixed fields. We present recent progress and ongoing developments with TURBO, a proof-of-concept demonstrator adapted for low energy protons. Characterisation measurements were performed to determine realistic parameters for beam transport and particle tracking modelling. Simulation and experimental studies are shown for an energy degrader.

rayyan-283077690,Integrating microdosimetric in vitro RBE models for particle therapy into TOPAS MC using the MicrOdosimetry-based modeliNg for RBE ASsessment (MONAS) tool,"Objective. In this paper, we present MONAS (MicrOdosimetry-based modelliNg for relative biological effectiveness (RBE) ASsessment) toolkit. MONAS is a TOPAS Monte Carlo extension, that combines simulations of microdosimetric distributions with radiobiological microdosimetry-based models for predicting cell survival curves and dose-dependent RBE. Approach. MONAS expands TOPAS microdosimetric extension, by including novel specific energy scorers to calculate the single- and multi-event specific energy microdosimetric distributions at different micrometer scales. These spectra are used as physical input to three different formulations of the microdosimetric kinetic m odel, and to the generalized stochastic microdosimetric model (GSM2), to predict dose-dependent cell survival fraction and RBE. MONAS predictions are then validated against experimental microdosimetric spectra and in vitro survival fraction data. To show the MONAS features, we present two different applications of the code: (i) the depth-RBE curve calculation from a passively scattered proton SOBP and monoenergetic 12C-ion beam by using experimentally validated spectra as physical input, and (ii) the calculation of the 3D RBE distribution on a real head and neck patient geometry treated with protons. Main results. MONAS can estimate dose-dependent RBE and cell survival curves from experimentally validated microdosimetric spectra with four clinically relevant radiobiological models. From the radiobiological characterization of a proton SOBP and 12C fields, we observe the well-known trend of increasing RBE values at the distal edge of the radiation field. The 3D RBE map calculated confirmed the trend observed in the analysis of the SOBP, with the highest RBE values found in the distal edge of the target. Significance. MONAS extension offers a comprehensive microdosimetry-based framework for assessing the biological effects of particle radiation in both research and clinical environments, pushing closer the experimental physics-based description to the biological damage assessment, contributing to bridging the gap between a microdosimetric description of the radiation field and its application in proton therapy treatment with variable RBE. © 2024 The Author(s).

Many efforts have been focused on proton therapy, while fewer studies were conducted considering a beam of carbon ions. In this work we show, through a simulation study, that it is possible to recognize in a pixelated detector a Prompt Gamma profile generated by the interaction of ions with matter (which is correlated to the Bragg curve) despite a very large neutron background typical of carbon-ion irradiation. In addition, we estimate of the theoretical uncertainty on the particle range determination, considering a Carbon pencil beam with different numbers of ions. For this purpose, we performed Monte Carlo simulations with the software FLUKA and, for data analysis, we implemented three different analytical methods to estimate the theoretical accuracy in the range retrieval for the simulated set-up. Results positively confirmed the correlation between the Bragg peak and the detection profiles. The analysis of the simulation data brought to a precision of few millimeters with a realistic spill intensity, with the three cited methods coherent between them in their predictions.

Yet, toxicity to healthy organs and cancer radioresistance limit the efficacy of targeted a-particle therapy (TAT). Identification of the radiation-activated mechanisms that drive cancer cell survival provides opportunities to develop new points for therapeutic interference to improve the efficacy and safety of TAT. Methods: Quantitative phosphoproteomics andmatching proteomics followed by the bioinformatics analysis were used to identify alterations in the signaling networks in response to TAT with the 225Ac -labeled minigastrin analog 225Ac -PPF11N (DOTA-(DGlu)6-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe) in A431 cells, which overexpress cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR). Western blot analysis and microscopy verified the activation of the selected signaling pathways. Small-molecule inhibitors were used to validate the potential of the radiosensitizing combinatory treatments both in vitro and in A431/CCKBR tumor-bearing nude mice. Results: TAT-induced alterations were involved in DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction, as well as RNA transcription and processing, cell morphology, and transport. Western blot analysis and microscopy confirmed increased phosphorylations of the key proteins involved in DNA damage response and carcinogenesis, including p53, p53 binding protein 1 (p53BP1), histone deacetylases (HDACs), and H2AX. Inhibition of HDAC class II, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and p38 kinases by TMP269, AZD1390, and SB202190, respectively, sensitized A431/ CCKBR cells to 225Ac -PP-F11N. As compared with the control and monotherapies, the combination of 225Ac -PP-F11N with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA) significantly reduced the viability and increased the DNA damage of A431/CCKBR cells, led to themost pronounced tumor growth inhibition, and extended themean survival of A431/CCKBR xenografted nudemice. Conclusion: Our study revealed the cellular responses to TAT and demonstrated the radiosensitizing potential of HDAC inhibitors to 225Ac -PP-F11N in CCKBR-positive tumors.

rayyan-1273747505,A novel range-verification method using ionoacoustic wave generated from spherical gold markers for particle-beam therapy: a simulation study,"This study proposes a novel alternative range-verification method for proton beam with acoustic waves generated from spherical metal markers. When proton beam is incident on metal markers, most of the resulting pressure waves are confined in the markers because of the large difference in acoustic impedance between the metal and tissue. However, acoustic waves with frequency equal to marker’s resonant frequency escape this confinement; the marker briefly acts as an acoustic transmitter. Herein, this phenomenon is exploited to measure the range of the proton beam. We test the proposed strategy in 3-D simulations, combining the dose calculations with modelling of acoustic-wave propagation. A spherical gold marker of 2.0 mm diameter was placed in water with a 60 MeV proton beam incident on it. We investigated the dependence of pressure waves on the width of beam pulse and marker position. At short beam pulse, specific high-frequency acoustic waves of 1.62 MHz originating from the marker were observed in wave simulations, whose amplitude correlated with the distance between the marker and Bragg peak. Results indicate that the Bragg peak position can be estimated by measuring the acoustic wave amplitudes from the marker, using a single detector properly designed for the resonance frequency. © 2019, The Author(s).",0,,The article discusses a novel range-verification method for proton beam therapy using ionoacoustic waves and does not involve AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273747507,Biological effectiveness of He-3 and He-4 ion beams for cancer hadrontherapy: A study based on the BIANCA biophysical model,"While cancer therapy with protons and C-ions is continuously spreading, in the near future patients will be also treated with He-ions which, in comparison to photons, combine the higher precision of protons with the higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-ions. Similarly to C-ions, also for He-ions the RBE variation along the beam must be known as precisely as possible, especially for active beam delivery systems. In this framework the BIANCA biophysical model, which has already been applied to calculate the RBE along proton and C-ion beams, was extended to 4He-ions and, following interface with the FLUKA code, was benchmarked against cell survival data on CHO normal cells and Renca tumour cells irradiated at different positions along therapeutic-like 4He-ion beams at the Heidelberg Ion-beam Therapy centre, where the first He-ion patient will be treated soon. Very good agreement between simulations and data was obtained, showing that BIANCA can now be used to predict RBE following irradiation with all ion types that are currently used, or will be used soon, for hadrontherapy. Thanks to the development of a reference simulation database describing V79 cell survival for ion and photon irradiation, these predictions can be cell-type specific because analogous databases can be produced, in principle, for any cell line. Furthermore, survival data on CHO cells irradiated by a He-3 beam were reproduced to compare the biophysical properties of He-4 and He-3 beams, which is currently an open question. This comparison showed that, at the same depth, He-4 beams tend to have a higher RBE with respect to He-3 beams, and that this difference is also modulated by the considered physical dose, as well as the cell radiosensitivity.

Purpose: To characterize tumor microstructure according to proliferative capacity and predict local recurrence through microstructural markers derived from pre-treatment conventional DW-MRI, in skull-base chordoma (SBC) patients treated with proton (PT) and carbon ion (CIRT) radiotherapy. Methods: Forty-eight patients affected by SBC, who underwent conventional DW-MRI before treatment and were enrolled for CIRT (n = 25) or PT (n = 23), were retrospectively selected. Clinically verified local recurrence information (LR) and histological information (Ki-67, proliferation index) were collected. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated from pre-treatment DW-MRI and, from these, a set of microstructural parameters (cellular radius R, volume fraction vf, diffusion D) were derived by applying a fine-tuning procedure to a framework employing Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic cell substrates. In addition, apparent cellularity (ρapp) was estimated from vf and R for an easier clinical interpretation. Histogram-based metrics (mean, median, variance, entropy) from estimated parameters were considered to investigate differences (Mann-Whitney U-test, α = 0.05) in estimated tumor microstructure in SBCs characterized by low or high cell proliferation (Ki-67). Recurrence-free survival analyses were also performed to assess the ability of the microstructural parameters to stratify patients according to the risk of local recurrence (Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test α = 0.05). Results: Refined microstructural markers revealed optimal capabilities in discriminating patients according to cell proliferation, achieving best results with mean values (p-values were 0.0383, 0.0284, 0.0284, 0.0468, and 0.0088 for ADC, R, vf, D, and ρapp, respectively). Recurrence-free survival analyses showed significant differences between populations at high and low risk of local recurrence as stratified by entropy values of estimated microstructural parameters (p = 0.0110).

In a first-in-human dose escalation trial of bone targeted Radium 223 dichloride alpha-particle therapy in 18 patients with advanced osteosarcoma only 1 patient responded based on conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Na18F PET response Criteria in Solid Tumors(NAFCIST), based on Sodium fluoride-18 (Na18F) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was developed to better evaluate bone specific response. To further appreciate the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the partial or mixed responses, a radiomics method was developed.

In the case of MRI-guided C-ion radiotherapy (MRgCT) scenario, as a therapeutic approach for future potential MR-guided particle therapy, C-ion beam will be deflected in the presence of the magnetic field. The curvature of the track causes a retraction of the range. This range variation might be different in various materials, which leads to change the WER values. To evaluate the WER variations versus magnetic field strength, in this research work, WER of some materials, including bladder, brain, prostate, muscle, bone, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyoxymethylene (POM), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), titanium (Ti), gold (Au), platinum (Pt); potentially encountered in C-ion radiotherapy dosimetry were assessed. A mono-energetic C-ion beam, incident on a volume containing materials as mentioned above, was simulated using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. To validate the simulated C-ion beams, the ion ranges in the water at the calculated energies (100-400 MeV/n) were compared with experimental and analytical data reported in the literature. Moreover, the calculated WER results were compared with available experimental data in the absence of the magnetic field. The WER values were calculated for the materials mentioned above in the presence of 0.35, 1.5, and 3 T magnetic fields and compared to the case without a magnetic field. Good agreement with the experimental data regarding range prediction in water was achieved. No change in the WER value was observed at 100 MeV/n and 0.35 T for all the studied materials and energies. In the case of bladder, brain, and prostate, and muscle materials, no change in WER values was observed by changing the magnetic field strength up to 3 T at the range of the studied energies. The maximum change in WER values by applying the magnetic fields is relevant to the Ti material (-0.4%), which occurs at 400 MeV/n energy and 3 T magnetic field. Considering the potential encounter of the studied materials in the clinical practice of MRgCT, in the form of phantoms, dosimeters, detectors, fiducial markers, radio-opaque clips, patient anatomies, etc., the results of this study highly contribute to assess the variation of WER values of the studied dosimetric materials and the changes in C-ion ranges within these materials when the transverse magnetic fields are applied to the materials subject to study.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.",0,[],The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on the effects of magnetic fields on WER using Monte Carlo simulations.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273747519,Nano-vesicles are a potential tool to monitor therapeutic efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy in prostate cancer,"Exosomes are nano-vesicles that contribute to the effectiveness of many treatments. The aim of this study was to identify profiles of microRNA (miRNA) contained in serum exosomes that are differentially regulated in patients with prostate cancer undergoing carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). RNA was extracted from serum exosomes of eight patients with localized prostate cancer before and after CIRT, and miRNA was analyzed by the next generation sequencing. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the major signaling pathways associated with the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, such as MAPK, PI3K-AKT, mTOR, and AMPK may be implicated in the mechanism of CIRT action. Notably, 57 miRNAs present in serum exosomes were significantly altered after application of CIRT. A high pre-CIRT expression level of specific miRNAs (miR-493-5p, miR-323a-3p, miR-411-5p, miR-494-3p, miR-379-5p, miR-654-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-543, and miR-200c-3p) predicted therapeutic benefit of CIRT (p<0.05). Post-CIRT expression of miR-654-3p and miR-379-5p was also associated with CIRT efficacy (p<0.05). These results suggest that the anti-prostate cancer mechanisms elicited by CIRT at the molecular level may involve exosomal miRNAs. Furthermore, specific miRNAs in serum exosomes, particularly miR-654-3p and miR-379-5p, may serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers predicting efficacy of CIRT for prostate cancer.

rayyan-1273747521,Carbon ion radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy: synergistic anti-tumor efficacy and preliminary investigation of ferroptosis,"Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) may yield satisfactory clinical outcomes for patients who are resistant to radiotherapy. However, the therapeutic impact of carbon ions is still limited in certain recurring or refractory tumors. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the synergistic anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with CIRT. We then explored the involvement of ferroptosis in a preliminary investigation. A tumor-bearing mouse model was established, and mice were inoculated subcutaneously with B16-OVA cells into the flanks of both hind legs. Mice were assigned to four groups to receive CIRT, ICIs, or combined treatment. Thereafter, we conducted transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), bioinformatics analysis, and various immune-related experiments on the available tumor tissues to investigate differences in the synergistic anticancer effects and potential mechanisms across the groups. The combination therapies significantly improved the survival of mice and inhibited tumor growth, both at local and distant sites. Based on bioinformatics and RNA-seq data, immune-related pathways and genes, immune cell infiltration, and the production of cytokines and chemokines were the most enhanced in the combined treatment group compared to other groups. Finally, we identified a potential role for ferroptosis in the development of local anti-tumor synergy during CIRT combination treatment. In conclusion, this study showed that CIRT and ICIs can enhance the anti-tumor immune effects. We also proposed that ferroptosis may induce anti-tumor effects in CIRT combination therapy, offering a unique perspective on its ability to enhance immunotherapy responses. © 2023, The Author(s).",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods applied to Carbon Ion Therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The model assumes that (i) ionizing radiation induces DNA ‘cluster lesions’ (CLs), where by definition each CL produces two independent chromosome fragments; (ii) fragment (distance-dependent) mis-rejoining, or un-rejoining, produces chromosome aberrations; (iii) some aberrations lead to cell death. The CL yield, which mainly depends on radiation quality but is also modulated by the target cell, is an adjustable parameter. The fragment un-rejoining probability, f, is the second, and last, parameter. The value of f, which is assumed to depend on the cell type but not on radiation quality, was taken from previous studies, and only the CL yield was adjusted in the present work. Good agreement between simulations and experimental data was obtained, suggesting that BIANCA II is suitable for calculating the biological effectiveness of hadrontherapy beams. For both V79 and AG01522 cells, the mean number of CLs per micrometer was found to increase with LET in a linear-quadratic fashion before the over-killing region, where a less rapid increase, with a tendency to saturation, was observed. Although the over-killing region deserves further investigation, the possibility of fitting the CL yields is an important feature for hadrontherapy, because it allows performing predictions also at LET values where experimental data are not available. Finally, an approach was proposed to predict the ion-response of the cell line(s) of interest from the ion-response of a reference cell line and the photon response of both.

rayyan-1273747528,Carbon ion radiotherapy eradicates medulloblastomas with chromothripsis in an orthotopic Li-Fraumeni patient-derived mouse model,"Background: Medulloblastomas with chromothripsis developing in children with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (germline TP53 mutations) are highly aggressive brain tumors with dismal prognosis. Conventional photon radiotherapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy are not successful for these patients and raise the risk of secondary malignancies. We hypothesized that the pronounced homologous recombination deficiency in these tumors might offer vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically utilized in combination with high linear energy transfer carbon ion radiotherapy. Methods: We tested high-precision particle therapy with carbon ions and protons as well as topotecan with or without PARP inhibitor in orthotopic primary and matched relapsed patient-derived xenograft models. Tumor and normal tissue underwent longitudinal morphological MRI, cellular (markers of neurogenesis and DNA damage-repair), and molecular characterization (whole-genome sequencing). Results: In the primary medulloblastoma model, carbon ions led to complete response in 79% of animals irrespective of PARP inhibitor within a follow-up period of 300 days postirradiation, as detected by MRI and histology. No sign of neurologic symptoms, impairment of neurogenesis or in-field carcinogenesis was detected in repair-deficient host mice. PARP inhibitors further enhanced the effect of proton irradiation. In the postradiotherapy relapsed tumor model, median survival was significantly increased after carbon ions (96 days) versus control (43 days, P <. 0001). No major change in the clonal composition was detected in the relapsed model. Conclusion: The high efficacy and favorable toxicity profile of carbon ions warrants further investigation in primary medulloblastomas with chromothripsis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of carbon-ion (C-ion) beam irradiation on PD-L1 expression in human uterine cervical adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma (UCAA) cells and clinical samples and to identify the prognostic factors for outcomes after C-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). Methods: The effects of C-ion irradiation on PD-L1 expression in human UCAA and cervical squamous cell carcinoma cells were examined by flow cytometry. We examined PD-L1 expression in UCAA biopsy specimens from 33 patients before CIRT started (pre-CIRT) and after 12 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) irradiation (post-12Gy-C) in 4 fractions of CIRT to investigate the correlation between PD-L1 status and clinical outcomes. Results: The PD-L1 expression was upregulated by C-ion beam in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa and SiHa cells through phosphorylated Chk1. The overall frequencies of pre-CIRT and post-12Gy-C PD-L1 positivity were 45% (15/33) and 67% (22/33), respectively. The post-12Gy-C PD-L1 expression was significantly elevated compared to the pre-CIRT PD-L1 expression. There was no significant relationship between the pre-CIRT PD-L1 status and clinical outcomes, such as local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). However, the post-12Gy-C PD-L1 expression had better correlation with PFS, but not with LC and OS.

This was a retrospective cohort study involving 85 patients who underwent a MET-PET or MET-PET/computed tomography (CT) examination before and after CIRT. MET uptake in the tumour was evaluated semi-quantitatively using the tumour-to-normal tissue ratio (TNR). Local recurrence, metastasis, and outcome predictions were studied in terms of TNR before CIRT (TNRpre), TNR after CIRT (TNRpost), and the TNR change ratio. Kaplan–Meier curves revealed significant differences between patients with higher TNRpre values and those with lower TNRpre values in regard to local recurrence, metastasis, and outcome (log-rank test P < 0.0001 for all three). There were also significant differences in metastasis rates and outcomes between patients with higher and lower TNRpost values (log-rank test P = 0.0105 and P = 0.027, respectively).

In multiple rodent models, Actinium-225-labeled hu11B6-IgG1 ([225Ac]hu11B6-IgG1) has shown promising treatment efficacy. In the present study, we investigated options to enhance and optimize [225Ac]hu11B6 treatment. First, we evaluated the possibility of exploiting IgG3, the IgG subclass with superior activation of complement and ability to mediate FC-receptor binding, for immunotherapeutically enhanced hK2 targeted α-radioimmunotherapy. Second, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of a single high activity vs. fractionated activity. Finally, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the genomic signatures of prostate cancer that progressed after targeted α-Therapy.

Additionally, carbon-ion beams provide a higher biological effectiveness, and thus a higher tumor control probability. However, information regarding the dose constraints for organs at risk in C-ion RT is limited. This study aimed to determine the predictive factors for late morbidities in the rectum and bladder after carbon-ion C-ion RT for uterus carcinomas. Methods: Between June 1995 and January 2010, 134 patients with uterus carcinomas were treated with C-ion RT with curative intent; prescription doses of 52.8-74.4 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) were delivered in 20-24 fractions. Of these patients, 132 who were followed up for > 6 months were analyzed. We separated the data in two subgroups, a 24 fractions group and a 20 fractions group. Late morbidities, proctitis, and cystitis were assessed according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. The correlations of clinical and dosimetric parameters, V10-V60, D5cc, D2cc, and Dmax, with the incidence of ≥grade 1 morbidities were retrospectively analyzed. Results: In the 24 fractions group, the 3-year actuarial occurrence rates of ≥grade 1 rectal and bladder morbidities were 64 and 9%, respectively. In addition, in the 20 fractions group, the 3-year actuarial occurrence rates of ≥grade 1 rectal and bladder morbidities were 32 and 19%, respectively. Regarding the dose-volume histogram data on the rectum, the D5cc and D2cc were significantly higher in patients with ≥grade 1 proctitis than in those without morbidity. In addition, the D5cc for the bladder was significantly higher in patients with ≥grade 1 cystitis than in those without morbidity. Results of univariate analyses showed that D2cc of the rectum was correlated with the development of ≥grade 1 late proctitis. Moreover, D5cc of the bladder was correlated with the development of ≥grade 1 late cystitis.

rayyan-1273747533,Technical Note: Predicting dose distribution with replacing stopping power ratio for inter-fractional motion and intra-fractional motion during carbon ion radiotherapy with passive irradiation method for stage I lung cancer,"Purpose: We designed and evaluated a simple method for predicting the effects of intra-fractional and/or inter-fractional motion on dose distribution during carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for solitary-lesion stage I lung cancer. Methods: The proposed method uses computed tomography (CT) images from treatment planning and intra-tumoral and/or inter-tumoral displacement. The predicted dose distribution (PDD) was calculated by replacing the current tumor region with the stopping power ratio (SPR) of the lung and replacing the moved tumor region with the SPR of the tumor. The actual dose distribution (ADD) was calculated without the replacement. Ten patients with solitary-lesion stage I lung cancer were retrospectively studied to evaluate the prediction method's accuracy. Four PDDs for intra-fractional motion (gate-in, exhalation, gate-out, inhalation phases during four-dimensional CT) and two PDDs for inter-fractional motion (CT images acquired 1–2 days before treatment) with bone- and tumor-matching methods were compared with each of six ADDs on each CT scan. Percentages of the planning/clinical target volumes (PTV/CTV) receiving >95% of the prescribed dose (V95) and of minimum doses covering 95% of the PTV/CTV (D95) were compared with dose volume histogram parameters. Results: The maximum tumor displacements occurred in the superior–inferior direction, with intra-fractional motion values of 3.75 and 8.97 mm for the superior and inferior directions, respectively, and inter-fractional values of 9.61 and 4.10 mm. The maximum average error for PTV V95 regarding intra-fractional motion was −0.43% for the gate-out phase and −0.63% for the inhalation phase. There were no significant differences for these parameters (P = 0.541, P = 0.571). Average errors for PTV and CTV V95 with inter-fractional motion with bone matching were 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, with no significant differences (P = 0.387, P = 0.155). Conclusions: The accuracy of the proposed method was good. Hence, it is feasible to use the proposed method during CIRT to predict dose distribution with respect to intra-fractional motion and/or inter-fractional motion of the tumor in patients with solitary-lesion stage I lung cancer. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",0,,The article does not explore or apply any AI methods in carbon ion therapy; it focuses on a physics-based approach to predict dose distribution using stopping power ratio replacement.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273747534,FGFR signaling as a candidate therapeutic target for cancers resistant to carbon ion radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy is an essential component of cancer therapy. Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) promises to improve outcomes compared with standard of care in many cancers. Nevertheless, clinicians often observe in-field recurrence after CIRT. This indicates the presence of a subset of cancers that harbor intrinsic resistance to CIRT. Thus, the development of methods to identify and sensitize CIRT-resistant cancers is needed. To address this issue, we analyzed a unique donor-matched pair of clinical specimens: a treatment-naïve tumor, and the tumor that recurred locally after CIRT in the same patient. Exon sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes identified enrichment of somatic mutations in FGFR3 and FGFR4 in the recurrent tumor compared with the treatment-naïve tumor, indicating a pivotal role for FGFR signaling in cancer cell survival through CIRT. Inhibition of FGFR using the clinically available pan-FGFR inhibitor LY2874455 sensitized multiple cancer cell lines to carbon ions at 3 Gy (RBE: relative biological effectiveness), the daily dose prescribed to the patient.

Biophysics models, such as the mMKM and NanOx models, have previously been developed to estimate a biological dose. Using the mMKM model, we calculated the saturation corrected dose mean specific energy z*1D (Gy) and the dose at 10%D10 for human salivary gland (HSG) cells using Monte Carlo Track Structure codes LPCHEM and Geant4-DNA, and compared these with data from the literature for monoenergetic ions. These two models were used to create databases of survival fraction coefficients for several ion types (hydrogen, carbon, helium and oxygen) and for energies ranging from 0.1 to 400 MeV/n. We calculated α values as a function of LET with the mMKM and the NanOx models, and compared these with the literature. In order to estimate the biological dose for SOBPs, these databases were used with a Monte Carlo toolkit. We considered GATE, an open-source software based on the GEANT4 Monte Carlo toolkit. We implemented a tool, the BioDoseActor, in GATE, using the mMKM and NanOx databases of cell survival predictions as input, to estimate, at a voxel scale, biological outcomes when treating a patient. We modeled the HIBMC 320 MeV/u carbon-ion beam line. We then tested the BioDoseActor for the estimation of biological dose, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and the cell survival fraction for the irradiation of the HSG cell line. We then tested the implementation for the prediction of cell survival fraction, RBE and biological dose for the HIBMC 320 MeV/u carbon-ion beamline. For the cell survival fraction, we obtained satisfying results. Concerning the prediction of the biological dose, a 10% relative difference between mMKM and NanOx was reported. © 2022 by the authors.

To maximize the efficacy of this extremely scarce medical resource, it is important to identify predictive biomarkers of higher carbon ion relative biological effectiveness (RBE) over photons. We addressed this issue by focusing on cellular antioxidant capacity and investigated64Cu(II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM), a potential radioligand that reflects an over-reduced intracellular environment. We found that the carbon ion RBE correlated with64Cu-ATSM uptake both in vitro and in vivo. High RBE/64Cu-ATSM cells showed greater steady-state levels of antioxidant proteins and increased capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species in response to X-rays than low RBE/64Cu-ATSM counterparts; this upregulation of antioxidant systems was associated with downregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. Furthermore, inhibition of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) sensitized high RBE/64Cu-ATSM cells to X-rays, thereby reducing RBE values to levels comparable to those in low RBE/64Cu-ATSM cells. These data suggest that the cellular activity of Nrf2-driven antioxidant systems is a possible determinant of carbon ion RBE predictable by64Cu-ATSM uptake. These new findings highlight the potential clinical utility of64Cu-ATSM imaging to identify high RBE tumors that will benefit from carbon ion radiotherapy. © 2021 by the authors.

The content talks about using a radioligand, 64Cu-ATSM, which reflects an over-reduced intracellular environment.

The conclusion suggests that 64Cu-ATSM imaging can identify tumors with high RBE, making them good candidates for carbon ion therapy. Now, looking at this, I don't see any mention of AI methods or applications. It's more about a radioligand and its predictive role in treatment efficacy based on cellular mechanisms.

Although the incidence of CIRT-induced radiation pneumonitis (RP) ≥ grade 2 ranges from 2.5 to 9.9%, the association between CIRT-induced RP and dosimetric parameters is not clear. Herein, we identified prognostic factors associated with symptomatic RP after CIRT for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods: Clinical results of 65 patients treated with CIRT between 2000 and 2015 at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical stage II B disease (TNM classification) was the most common stage among the patients (45%). The median radiation dose was 72 Gy (68-76) relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in 16 fractions. In cases involving metastatic lymph nodes, prophylactic irradiation of mediastinal lymph nodes was performed at a median dose of 49.5 Gy (RBE). The median follow-up was 22 months. Results: Grade 2 and grade 3 RP occurred in 6 and 3 patients (9 and 5%), respectively. No patients developed grade 4 or 5 RP. Using univariate analysis, vital capacity as a percentage of predicted (%VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), mean lung dose (MLD), volume of lung receiving ≥5 Gy (RBE) (V5), V10, V20 and V30 were determined to be the significant predictive factors for ≥ grade 2 RP. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the cutoff values for %VC, FEV1, MLD, V5, V10, V20 and V30 for ≥ grade 2 RP, which were 86.9%, 1.16 L, 12.5 Gy (RBE), 28.8, 29.9, 20.1 and 15.0%, respectively. In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that %VC <86.9% (odds ratio = 13.7; p = 0.0041) and V30 ≥ 15% (odds ratio = 6.1; p = 0.0221) were significant risk factors.

The aim of this work is to compare the performances of survival models fed with dosiomics features and conventional DVH metrics extracted from relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose (DRBE) and dose-averaged Linear Energy Transfer (LETd) maps, towards the identification of possible prognostic factors for LR in SC patients treated with CIRT. This retrospective study included 50 patients affected by SC with a focus on patients that presented a relapse in a high-dose region. Survival models were built to predict both LR and High-Dose Local Recurrencies (HD-LR). The models were evaluated through Harrell Concordance Index (C-index) and patients were stratified into high/low-risk groups. Local Recurrence-free Kaplan–Meier curves were estimated and evaluated through log-rank tests. The model with highest performance (median(interquartile-range) C-index of 0.86 (0.22)) was built on features extracted from LETd maps, with DRBE models showing promising but weaker results (C-index of 0.83 (0.21), 0.80 (0.21)). Although the study should be extended to a wider patient population, LETd maps show potential as a prognostic factor for SC HD-LR in CIRT, and dosiomics appears to be the most promising approach against more conventional methods (e.g., DVH-based). © 2022 by the authors.",1,['Survival Models'],The article applies machine learning models to predict local recurrence in sacral chordomas using dosiomics features from carbon-ion radiotherapy data.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Methods: Twenty-nine LRNPC patients who underwent whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning before CIRT were enrolled. Heterogeneity index (HI)-based 18F-FDG uptake, and the PET/CT traditional parameters, including SUVmax, MTV, and TLG were assessed. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) determined the best cutoff value, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test. And the predictive ability was evaluated by the ROC curve. Cox analyses were performed on LRFS and PFS. Results: In this study, univariate analysis showed that HI was a significant predictor of LRNPC treated by CIRT. HI could be used to predict LRFS and PFS. Patients with HI (≥ 0.81) had a significantly worse prognosis of LRFS (12.25 vs. NR, p = 0.008), and of PFS (10.58 vs. NR, p = 0.014). The AUC and its sensitivity and sensitivity and specificity were 0.75, 84.21% and 70.00% for LRFS and 0.82, 80.95% and 75.00% for PFS, respectively.

By using these values, the predictions of BIANCA were compared with experimental data of RBE, and good agreement was found. After this validation step, the FLUKA radiation transport code, which can produce physical dose profiles for typical hadrontherapy beams, could read the α and β tables; thanks to such an interface between FLUKA and BIANCA, probabilities of cell death were predicted along depth-dose profiles.

The predictive factors for acute skin reactions after CIRT have not been investigated. The present study aimed to identify these factors and evaluate the correlation between the severity of acute skin reactions and skin dose parameters. Methods: CIRT with total doses of 64.0-70.4Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) was administered to 22 patients with MBSTs. The skin-tumor distance (STD), maximum skin total dose (Dmax), and area of the skin receiving a total dose of X Gy (RBE) were evaluated. Results: All patients developed acute skin reactions after CIRT, including Grades 1 and 2 dermatitis in 15 (71%) and 6 (29%) patients, respectively. There was a significant difference in the STD between the two groups (P=0.007), and the cut-off value of STD for predicting Grade 2 acute skin reactions was 11mm. There was a significant difference in Dmax between the groups (P<0.001), and the cut-off value of Dmax for predicting Grade 2 acute skin reactions was 52Gy (RBE). Significant differences between the two groups were observed in terms of the area irradiated with 40Gy (RBE) (S40), and the cut-off value of S40 for predicting Grade 2 acute skin reactions was 25cm2.

Such critical complications can lead to high mortality rates. Rapid detection methods are, therefore, necessary to detect Strongyloides infection in POCT with the advantage of being applicable in a developing country. Methods: Two hundred POCT have been enrolled in this study to determine the rate of infection with Strongyloides. Three different groups of POCT (Strongyloides infected, non-infected, infected with other parasites) were used to evaluate the antibodies detection capability of two serological techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gelatin particles indirect agglutination (GPIAT) against the results of the gold standard agar plate culture (APC). Results: With APC, the infection rate of Strongyloides stercoralis in POCT was 9.5% (19/200). POCT with Strongyloides infection displayed related risk factors (job, rural settlements, and soil contact) for infection combined with the subtropical nature of Ismailia Governorate. With regard to serology, ELISA detection results were poor compared to APC with sensitivity and specificity of 42.1% and 82.6%, respectively, and positive and negative predictive values of 72% and 30%. GPIAT appeared to be closely related to APC with sensitivity and specificity of 89.4% and 81.8%, respectively, and positive and negative predictive values of 80.9% and 96.7%. Statistical moderate correlation was detected between GPIAT and ELISA.

Methods: Between June 2015 and October 2018, 50 consecutive and nonselected patients with glioblastoma multiforme (n = 34) or anaplastic glioma (n = 16) were treated at the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center. Twenty-four patients received proton radiotherapy (at a dose of 60 gray-equivalents in 30 daily fractions), and 26 patients received proton radiotherapy plus a carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) boost in various dose-escalating schemes. All patients received temozolomide because of their age or their O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, as well as treatment-induced toxicities, were analyzed. Results: At a median follow-up of 14.3 months (range, 4.8-39.6 months), the 12-month and 18-month OS rates were 87.8% (95% CI, 77.6%-98.0%) and 72.8% (95% CI, 56.7%-88.9%), respectively, and the 12-month and 18-month PFS rates were 74.2% (95% CI, 60.9%-87.5%) and 59.8% (95% CI, 43.1%-76.5%), respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that age (>50 vs ≤50 years), World Health Organization grade (3 vs 4), and Karnofsky performance status (>80 vs ≤80) were significant prognosticators for OS, and IDH mutation and World Health Organization grade were significant for predicting PFS. Furthermore, MGMT promoter methylation, performance status, and age showed a trend toward predicting PFS. No significant predictive factors for PFS or OS were identified in multivariate analyses. Twenty-nine patients experienced grade 1 treatment-related acute adverse effects, and 11 developed grade 1 (n = 6) or grade 2 (n = 5) late adverse effect of radiation-induced brain necrosis.

Methods and Materials: The PRECISE (PaRticle thErapy using single and Combined Ion optimization StratEgies) treatment planning system was developed to investigate clinical viability of CICR treatments. Single-field uniform dose (SFUD) with a single ion (proton [p], helium [He], or carbon [C]) and CICR (C-p and C-He) treatments were generated for 3 patient cases with a clinically prescribed dose of 3 Gy (RBE) per fraction. Spread-out Bragg peak plans were irradiated in homogenous and clinical-like settings using an anthropomorphic head phantom. A dosimetric and biological verification of CICRC-p treatments using a murine glioma cell line (GL261) was performed. Results: CICR treatment plans for the 3 patients presented highly uniform physical dose while reducing high dose-averaged linear energy transfer gradients compared with carbon ions alone. When considering uncertainty in tissue parameter (α/β)x assignment and RBE modeling, the CICRC-p treatment exhibited enhanced biophysical stability within the target volume, similar to protons alone. CICR treatments reduced dose to normal tissue surrounding the target, exhibiting similar or improved dosimetric features compared with SFUDHe. For both CICRC-p and SFUD treatments, measurements verified the planned dose in the target within ∼3%. Planned versus measured target RBE values were 1.38 ± 0.02 and 1.39 ± 0.07 (<1% deviation), respectively, for the CICRC-p treatment in heterogenous settings. Conclusions: Here, we demonstrate that by combining 2 (or more) ions in a single field arrangement, more robust biological and more conformal dose distributions can be delivered compared with conventional particle therapy treatment planning.

rayyan-1273747548,Computer-assisted beam modeling for particle therapy,"Purpose: To develop a computer-driven and thus less user-dependent method, allowing for a simple and straightforward generation of a Monte Carlo (MC) beam model of a scanned proton and carbon ion beam delivery system. Methods: In a first step, experimental measurements were performed for proton and carbon ion energies in the available energy ranges. Data included depth dose profiles measured in water and spot sizes in air at various isocenter distances. Using an automated regularization-based optimization process (AUTO-BEAM), GATE/Geant4 beam models of the respective beam lines were generated. These were obtained sequentially by using least square weighting functions with and without regularization, to iteratively tune the beam parameters energy, energy spread, beam sigma, divergence, and emittance until a user-defined agreement was reached. Based on the parameter tuning for a set of energies, a beam model was semi-automatically generated. The resulting beam models were validated for all centers comparing to independent measurements of laterally integrated depth dose curves and spot sizes in air. For one representative center, three-dimensional dose cubes were measured and compared to simulations. The method was applied on one research as well as four different clinical beam lines for proton and carbon ions of three different particle therapy centers using synchrotron or cyclotron accelerator systems: (a) MedAustron ion therapy center, (b) University Proton Therapy Dresden, and (c) Center Antoine Lacassagne Nice. Results: Particle beam ranges in the MC beam models agreed on average within 0.2 mm compared to measurements for all energies and beam lines. Spot sizes in air (full-width at half maximum) at all positions differed by less than 0.4% from the measurements. Dose calculation with the beam model for the clinical beam line at MedAustron agreed better than 1.7% in absolute dose for a representative clinical case treated with protons. For protons, beam model generation, including geometry creation, data conversion, and validation, was possible within three working days. The number of iterations required for the optimization process to converge, was found to be similar for all beam line geometries and particle types. Conclusion: The presented method was demonstrated to work independently of the beam optics behavior of the different beam lines, particle types, and geometries.

An accurate study of the ion beam fragmentation is important for both the evaluation of secondaries field inside and outside the target volume (i.e. for radioprotection and biological effects evaluation) and the prediction of nuclear particle interactions and their reaction products. In this study we investigate the depth energy deposition (Bragg curve) and the rate of secondary particles produced in the interaction between 12C and targets of different materials (water and Plexiglas). Simple irradiation setup was first implemented for a preliminary comparison of the Geant4 code with literature studies [1,2]. A good agreement (∼0.04%) was found for the Bragg peak position and the peak-to-plateau ratio (∼0.3%). The complete CNAO [3] (Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica) extraction beamline with the target water phantom was then simulated for a characterization of secondary particles energy deposition along the beam axis, angular distributions for outgoing protons, neutrons, heavy secondary particles and prompt gammas. An agreement within 0.03% was found for the Bragg peak position with respect to CNAO data and Fluka simulation for 279.97 MeV/u 12C, highlighting the reliability of the Geant4 simulation. Preliminary results agree with literature studies but experimental data are needed to validate the code. Comparisons with additional simulation codes are foreseen.

Methods and Materials: We investigated patients with head and neck cancer whose Eustachian tube was irradiated by CIRT between October 2013 and December 2018 at our institution. OME severity was assessed by the proportion of mastoid cell opacification of magnetic resonance or computed tomography imaging (grade 0: <5% of volume of mastoid cell with opacification by fluid collection; grade 1: 6%-33%; grade 2: 34%-67%; and grade 3: 68%-100%). Clinical factors and dosimetric parameters affecting the development of grade 2 to 3 OME were analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: In total, 141 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 25.2 months. Grade 2 to 3 OME was observed in 65 patients, with a median incidence period of 6.5 months. According to the multivariate analysis, the mean dose of the cartilage part was a significant independent predictive parameter of grade 2 to 3 OME. The 2-year incidence rate of patients with a mean dose of the cartilage part of <40.59 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) and ≥40.59 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) was 24.2% (95% confidence interval, 15.1%-37.4%) and 66.4% (95% confidence interval, 54.5%-78.0%), respectively.

They are related to the effects of low dose halo and asymmetric spot shape. Empirically, a two-component Gaussian analytical model predicted the trend of rDOF and TP as a function of field size. From the result, the in-air spot size was described by a single Gaussian function for carbon-ion and high energy proton. The weights and widths for the second component of double Gaussian increased significantly as the beam energy decreases for protons. The TP fitting agreed with the rDOF fit for the scanned field (SF) of larger than 78 mm. For proton, the TP for SF of 12.0 mm for energies of 153.36 MeV/u and197.23 MeV/u, SF of 60.0 mm for energy of 48.08 MeV/u were fit better by single Gaussian component. The width of TP showed no field size dependence for each energy. Obtained Gaussian width by fitting TP was smaller than by fitting rDOF for carbon-ion.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) and environmental control/engineering is advised. High velocity nasal insufflation (HVNI) and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) deliver high flow oxygen (HFO) therapy, established as a competent means of supporting oxygenation for acute respiratory distress patients, including that precipitated by COVID-19. Although unlikely to present a disproportionate particle dispersal risk, AGP from HFO continues to be a concern. Previously, we published a preliminary model. Here, we present a subsequent highresolution simulation (higher complexity/reliability) to provide a more accurate and precise particle characterization on the effect of surgical masks on patients during HVNI, low-flow oxygen therapy (LFO2), and tidal breathing. Methods: This in silico modeling study of HVNI, LFO2, and tidal breathing presents ANSYS fluent computational fluid dynamics simulations that evaluate the effect of Type I surgical mask use over patient face on particle/droplet behavior. Results: This in silico modeling simulation study of HVNI (40 L min−1) with a simulated surgical mask suggests 88.8% capture of exhaled particulate mass in the mask, compared to 77.4% in LFO2 (6 L min−1) capture, with particle distribution escaping to the room (> 1 m from face) lower for HVNI+Mask versus LFO2+Mask (8.23% vs 17.2%). The overwhelming proportion of particulate escape was associated with mask-fit designed model gaps. Particle dispersion was associated with lower velocity.

rayyan-1273747553,Particle therapy patient scheduling with limited starting time variations of daily treatments,"The particle therapy patient scheduling problem (PTPSP) arises in modern cancer treatment facilities that provide particle therapy. It consists of scheduling a set of therapies within a planning horizon of several months. A particularity of PTSP compared with classical radiotherapy scheduling is that therapies need not only be assigned to days but also scheduled within each day to account for the more complicated operational scenario. In an earlier work, we introduced this novel problem setting and provided first algorithms including an iterated greedy (IG) metaheuristic. In this work, we consider an important extension to the PTPSP emerging from practice in which the therapies should be provided on treatment days roughly at the same time. To be more specific, the variation between the starting times of the therapies' individual treatments should not exceed the given limits, and needs otherwise to be minimized. This additional constraint implies that the sequencing parts within each day can no longer be treated independently. To tackle this variant of PTPSP, we revise our previous IG and exchange its main components: the part of the applied construction heuristic for scheduling within the days and the local search algorithm. The resulting metaheuristic provides promising results for the proposed extension of the PTPSP and further enhances the existing approach for the original problem. © 2018 The Authors.

We integrated the data from published articles, clinical trials websites, and our data. The efficacy of CIRT for prostate cancer was assessed in terms of overall survival, biochemical recurrence-free survival, and toxicity response. Up to now, clinical treatment of carbon ion radiotherapy has been carried in only five countries. We found that carbon ion radiotherapy induced little genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity when used for prostate cancer treatment. To some extent, it led to improved outcomes in overall survival, biochemical recurrence-free survival than conventional radiotherapy, especially for high-risk prostate cancer.

However, estimating the distribution of Cerenkov light with this correction method is time-consuming, depending on the irradiated energy of protons by Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, we proposed a method of estimating dose distributions from the measured luminescence images of water using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Methods: In this study, we adopted the U-Net architectures as the DCNN. To prepare a large amount of image data for DCNN training, we calculated the training data pairs of two-dimensional (2D) dose distributions and luminescence images of water by Monte Carlo simulation for protons and carbon ions. After training the U-Net model for protons or carbon ions using these dose distributions and luminescence images calculated by Monte Carlo simulation, we predicted the dose distributions from the calculated and measured luminescence images of water using the trained U-Net model. Results: All of the U-Net model's predicted images were in good agreement with the MC-calculated dose distributions and showed lower values of the root mean square percentage error (RSMPE) and higher values in the structural similarity index (SSIM) in comparison with these values for calculated or measured luminescence images.

rayyan-1273747556,Modeling in vivo relative biological effectiveness in particle therapy for clinically relevant endpoints,Background: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of particle therapy compared to photon radiotherapy is known to be variable but the exact dependencies are still subject to debate. In vitro data suggested that RBE is to a large extend independent of ion type if parametrized by the beam quality Q. This study analyzed the RBE dependence of pre-clinical data on late toxicity with an emphasis on the beam quality. Material and methods: Published pre-clinical RBE dose-response data of the spinal cord following one and two fractions of photon and carbon ion irradiation were compiled. The beam quality for each treatment condition was obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The αp and βp parameters of the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for particle irradiation were determined from the pre-clinical data and was provided as a function of Q. An introduced model proposed αp to increase linearly with Q and βp to remain constant. RBE values predicted by the model were compared to the published data. Results: The αp parameter was highly correlated with Q (R2 = 0.96) with a linear slope of 0.019 Gy−1. No significant variation of βp with Q was found. RBE and Q were also highly correlated (R2 = 0.98) for one and two fractions. The (extrapolated) RBE at Q = 0 (theoretical photon limit) for one and two fractions was 1.22 and significantly larger than 1 (p =.004). The model reproduced the dependence of RBE on fractionation well. Conclusions: Fraction dose and beam quality Q were sufficient to describe the RBE variability for a late toxicity model within a carbon ion treatment field. Assuming the independence of the identified RBE parameters on the ion type might suggest the translation of variable (pre-) clinical RBE data from carbon ion to proton therapy. © 2017 Acta Oncologica Foundation.,0,,The study does not explore or apply any AI methods; it uses traditional statistical modeling and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze RBE in particle therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

The title mentions modeling RBE for clinically relevant endpoints, which sounds like a computational approach but not necessarily AI. The background talks about how RBE varies with ion type when parametrized by beam quality Q. They used pre-clinical data on late toxicity from spinal cord irradiation with photons and carbon ions. Their methods involved compiling this data, using Monte Carlo simulations to get the beam quality, then determining alpha_p and beta_p parameters of the LQ model as functions of Q. They proposed a model where alpha_p increases linearly with Q and beta_p remains constant. Then they compared their model's predictions to published data. The results showed high correlations between alpha_p and Q, RBE and Q, etc. Conclusions suggest that fraction dose and beam quality Q can describe RBE variability for late toxicity in carbon ion therapy. They also mention the possibility of translating these findings from carbon ions to protons. Now, looking at this, I don't see any mention of AI methods like machine learning, neural networks, or other computational techniques typically classified under AI.

Intraocular hemorrhage associated with carbon-ion radiotherapy for head and neck cancer is largely an unresearched area; hence, we investigated its incidence and predictive factors. Material and methods: We evaluated 79 patients (i.e., 158 eyes) with nonsquamous cancers of the head and neck treated by carbon-ion radiotherapy with a follow-up period of ≥12 months. Dosimetric parameters such as Dmax, Dmean and Vd [volume irradiated with “d” Gy (RBE)] and age, gender, primary site, histology and comorbidities were analyzed as predictors of intraocular hemorrhage. Results: Seven (8.9%) of 79 patients (158 eyes) developed intraocular hemorrhage with a median latent period of 24 months (range, 15–47 months). The 5-year cumulative incidence of intraocular hemorrhage was 6%.

This problem models, for example, the scheduling of patients during one day in a particle therapy facility for cancer treatment. First, we show that the tackled problem is NP-hard. We then present a construction heuristic and a novel A* algorithm, both on the basis of an effective lower bound calculation. For comparison, we also model the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). An extensive experimental evaluation on three types of problem instances shows that A* typically works extremely well, even in the context of large instances with upto 1000 jobs. When our A* does not terminate with proven optimality, which might happen due to excessive memory requirements, it still returns an approximate solution with a usually small optimality gap.

Here, we developed a uniformly sized Ag2S/BaSO4/DOX@PEGDAMS that integrates embolization, drug loading, and visualization with a microfluidic device. The microspheres can be imaged stably under NIR-II/X-ray for a long time, and the luminescence of NIR-II is better than that of X-ray. This breaks the limitations of conventional X-ray-only imaging of embolic microspheres. The microscope images and scanning electron microscope EDS results showed that the microspheres were regularly spherical with uniform particle size, and the signature elements such as Ag, S, and Ba were uniformly distributed in the microspheres. In vitro cytotoxicity assays and apoptosis assays have demonstrated that the microspheres have good biocompatibility and can effectively inhibit tumor cell growth due to the presence of DOX. The ability of microspheres to aggregate in blood vessels and block blood flow was verified by modeling and embolizing in rabbit ear tumors.

Upon coinfection with infectious standard virus (STV), DIPs interfere with STV replication through competitive inhibition. Thus, DIPs are proposed as potent antivirals for treatment of the influenza disease. To select corresponding candidates, we studied de novo generation of DIPs and propagation competition between different defective interfering (DI) vRNAs in an STV coinfection scenario in cell culture. A small-scale two-stage cultivation system that allows long-term semi-continuous propagation of IAV and its DIPs was used. Strong periodic oscillations in virus titers were observed due to the dynamic interaction of DIPs and STVs. Using next-generation sequencing, we detected a predominant formation and accumulation of DI vRNAs on the polymerase-encoding segments. Short DI vRNAs accumulated to higher fractions than longer ones, indicating a replication advantage, yet an optimum fragment length was observed. Some DI vRNAs showed breaking points in a specific part of their bundling signal (belonging to the packaging signal), suggesting its dispensability for DI vRNA propagation. Over a total cultivation time of 21 days, several individual DI vRNAs accumulated to high fractions, while others decreased. Using reverse genetics for IAV, purely clonal DIPs derived from highly replicating DI vRNAs were generated. We confirm that these DIPs exhibit a superior in vitro interfering efficacy compared to DIPs derived from lowly accumulated DI vRNAs and suggest promising candidates for efficacious antiviral treatment. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

rayyan-1273747561,Clinical outcomes of carbon-ion radiotherapy for patients with locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Background: Reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LR-NPC) after high-dose radiotherapy (RT) is challenging and usually is associated with poor survival and severe toxicities. Because of its physical and biological advantages over photon-beam RT, carbon-ion RT (CIRT) could be a potential treatment option for patients with LR-NPC. Methods: Patients with LR-NPC who underwent salvage therapy using CIRT at the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center between May 2015 and June 2019 were analyzed. CIRT doses were 50 to 69 gray equivalent (GyE) (2.0-3.0 GyE per fraction). Overall survival (OS), local control, regional control, distant control, and acute and late toxicities were analyzed. Univariable and multivariable analyses of OS and local control were performed using the Cox regression model. Results: Among the 206 patients included, 139 patients (67.5%) had recurrent American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV disease. With a median follow-up of 22.8 months, the 2-year OS, local control, regional control, and distant control rates were 83.7%, 58.0%, 87.3%, and 94.7%, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that older age (P =.017) was predictive of worse OS, whereas a larger tumor volume (P =.049) and a lower biological equivalent dose (P =.029) were associated with inferior local control. No patient developed an acute toxicity of ≥grade 3 during CIRT. Severe (≥grade 3) late toxicities included temporal lobe necrosis (0.97%), cranial neuropathy (0.49%), hearing loss (1.46%), xerostomia (0.49%), and mucosal necrosis (16.02%) (toxicities were graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria). Conclusions: Salvage treatment using CIRT is efficacious for patients with LR-NPC and its toxicities are acceptable. CIRT may improve the survival and toxicity profiles substantially for patients with LR-NPC compared with the reported results after photon-based intensity-modulated RT. © 2020 The Authors.

We enrolled 55 patients with a pelvic tumor adjacent to the GI tract. Virtual spacers were defined as the overlap volume between the GI tract and the volume expanded 7-17 mm from the gross tumor volume (GTV). Simulation plans (70 Gy in 35 fractions for at least 95% of the planning target volume [PTV]) were created with the lowest possible dose to the GI tract under conditions that meet the dose constraints of the PTV. We defined the minimum thickness of virtual spacers meeting D2 cc of the GI tract <50 Gy as 'MTS'. Multiple regression was used with explanatory variables to develop a model to predict MTS. We discovered that MTSs were at most 9 mm and 13 mm for C-ion RT and photon RT plans, respectively. The volume of overlap between the GI tract and a virtual spacer of 14 mm in thickness (OV14)-PTV was found to be the most important explanatory variable in the MTS prediction equation for both C-ion and photon RT plans. Multiple R2 values for the regression model were 0.571 and 0.347 for C-ion RT and photon RT plans, respectively. In conclusion, regression equations were developed to predict MTS in C-ion RT and photon RT.  © 2021 The Author(s).

rayyan-1273747563,Diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy: approximate modeling of the macroscopic alpha particle dose of a point source,"Diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy ('DaRT') is a new cancer-treatment modality, which enables treating solid tumors by alpha particles. The treatment utilizes implantable seeds embedded with a low activity of radium-224. Each seed continuously emits the short-lived alpha-emitting daughters of radium-224, which spread over several mm around it, creating a 'kill region' of high alpha-particle dose. DaRT is presently tested in clinical trials, starting with locally advanced and recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin and head and neck, with promising results with respect to both efficacy and safety. This work aims to provide a simple model which can serve as a zero-order approximation for DaRT dosimetry, allowing for calculating the macroscopic alpha particle dose of a point source, as a basis for more realistic source geometries. The model consists of diffusion equations for radon-220, lead-212 and bismuth-212, with the other short-lived daughters in local secular equilibrium. For simplicity, the medium is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic and time-independent. Vascular effects are accounted for by effective diffusion and clearance terms. To leading order, the alpha particle dose can be described by simple analytic expressions, which shed light on the underlying physics. The calculations demonstrate that, for a reasonable choice of model parameters, therapeutic alpha-particle dose levels are obtained over a region measuring 4-7 mm in diameter for sources carrying a few Ci of radium-224. The model predictions served as the basis for treatment planning in the SCC clinical trial, where treatments employing DaRT seeds carrying 2 Ci of radium-224 and spaced 5 mm apart resulted in ∼ complete response of the treated tumors with no observed radiation-induced toxicity. The promising results of the SCC clinical trial indicate that in spite of its approximate nature, the simple diffusion-based dosimetry model provides a quantitative starting point for DaRT treatment planning. © 2020 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",0,,The article discusses modeling of alpha particle dose in Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy (DaRT) and does not explore AI methods or applications related to Carbon Ion Therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

For the first time, HeCT based range prediction accuracy in a heterogeneous tissue phantom is presented and compared to single-energy x-ray CT (SECT), dual-energy x-ray CT (DECT) and proton CT (pCT). HeCT and pCT scans were acquired using the US pCT collaboration prototype particle CT scanner at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center. SECT and DECT scans were done with a Siemens Somatom Definition Flash and converted to RSP. A Catphan CTP404 module was used to study the RSP accuracy of HeCT. A custom phantom of 20 cm diameter containing several tissue equivalent plastic cubes was used to assess the spatial resolution of HeCT and compare it to DECT. A clinically realistic heterogeneous tissue phantom was constructed using cranial slices from a pig head placed inside a cylindrical phantom ( 150 mm). A proton beam (84.67 mm range) depth-dose measurement was acquired using a stack of GafchromicTM EBT-XD films in a central dosimetry insert in the phantom. CT scans of the phantom were acquired with each modality, and proton depth-dose estimates were simulated based on the reconstructions. The RSP accuracy of HeCT for the plastic phantom was found to be 0.3  0.1%. The spatial resolution for HeCT of the cube phantom was 5.9  0.4 lp cm-1 for central, and 7.6  0.8 lp cm-1 for peripheral cubes, comparable to DECT spatial resolution (7.7  0.3 lp cm-1 and 7.4  0.2 lp cm-1, respectively). For the pig head, HeCT, SECT, DECT and pCT predicted range accuracy was 0.25%, -1.40%, -0.45% and 0.39%, respectively. In this study, HeCT acquired with a prototype system showed potential for particle therapy treatment planning, offering RSP accuracy, spatial resolution, and range prediction accuracy comparable to that achieved with a commercial DECT scanner.

rayyan-1273747565,A Comparison Study of Machine Learning (Random Survival Forest) and Classic Statistic (Cox Proportional Hazards) for Predicting Progression in High-Grade Glioma after Proton and Carbon Ion Radiotherapy,"Background: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly explored in glioma prognostication. Random survival forest (RSF) is a common ML approach in analyzing time-to-event survival data. However, it is controversial which method between RSF and traditional cornerstone method Cox proportional hazards (CPH) is better fitted. The purpose of this study was to compare RSF and CPH in predicting tumor progression of high-grade glioma (HGG) after particle beam radiotherapy (PBRT). Methods: The study enrolled 82 consecutive HGG patients who were treated with PBRT at Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center between 6/2015 and 11/2019. The entire cohort was split into the training and testing set in an 80/20 ratio. Ten variables from patient-related, tumor-related and treatment-related information were utilized for developing CPH and RSF for predicting progression-free survival (PFS). The model performance was compared in concordance index (C-index) for discrimination (accuracy), brier score (BS) for calibration (precision) and variable importance for interpretability. Results: The CPH model demonstrated a better performance in terms of integrated C-index (62.9%) and BS (0.159) compared to RSF model (C-index = 61.1%, BS = 0.174). In the context of variable importance, CPH model indicated that age (P = 0.024), WHO grade (P = 0.020), IDH gene (P = 0.019), and MGMT promoter status (P = 0.040) were significantly correlated with PFS in the univariate analysis; multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.041), surgical completeness (P = 0.084), IDH gene (P = 0.057), and MGMT promoter (P = 0.092) had a significant or trend toward the relation with PFS. RSF showed that merely IDH and age were of positive importance for predicting PFS. A final nomogram was developed to predict tumor progression at the individual level based on CPH model. Conclusions: In a relatively small dataset with HGG patients treated with PBRT, CPH outperformed RSF for predicting tumor progression. A comprehensive criterion with accuracy, precision, and interpretability is recommended in evaluating ML prognostication approaches for clinical deployment. © Copyright © 2020 Qiu, Gao, Yang, Hu, Hu, Kong and Lu.",1,['Random Survival Forest'],The study applies machine learning (Random Survival Forest) and compares it with traditional statistical methods for predicting tumor progression after carbon ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Carbon-ion radiation therapy was given at a total dose of 59.4 to 95.4 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) in 18 fractions, at 72 Gy[RBE] in 9 fractions, at 52.8 to 60 Gy[RBE] in 4 fractions, and at 28 to 50 Gy[RBE] in a single fraction. Methods and Materials: A meta-analysis of published clinical data from 394 patients presenting with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer was conducted. Tumor control probability modeling based on the LQ and USC models was performed by simultaneously fitting the clinical data obtained from the different fractionation schedules while considering several spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) sizes. Radiobiological parameters were derived from the fit. On the basis of the results, a novel SOBP was created for the single-fraction regimen that was optimized with respect to the USC model and aimed at achieving a 95% local control. Results: The USC model gave a better fit to the 3-year local control data than the LQ model did. The fit using various SOBP sizes yielded transition doses between 5.6 and 7.0 Gy. The results also revealed α/β ratios between 7.4 and 9.1 Gy for the LQ model and between 7.4 and 9.4 Gy for the USC model. Conclusions: The USC model provided a better estimate of the local control rate for the single-fraction course. For the schemes with a greater number of fractions, the local control rate estimates from the LQ and USC models were comparable. A USC-based SOBP design was then created for the single-fraction schedule. The updated design resulted in a flatter RBE profile compared with the conventional SOBP design.

Making use of a large fraction of the secondary particles available, hybrid prompt gamma-ray and fast neutron imaging is a promising approach for this purpose. We present a simulation study introducing a novel method for range reconstruction by means of these particles. To this end, the passage of a proton beam through a patient and the detection of secondary particles in a dedicated detector array were simulated by Monte Carlo particle transport calculations. Anatomical variations were mimicked by adding or removing tissue to the patient. The secondary particle production vertices were reconstructed from the events registered by the detector based on scatter kinematics and maximum likelihood expectation maximisation. The vertices were projected onto the beam axis and the most predictive features of the resulting distributions were identified from a standardised feature set by forward feature selection and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). A range-shift sensitivity of 1 mm or less was reached at intensities of 1.2×107 protons per spot with fast neutrons, and at 2.6×107 protons per spot with prompt gamma-rays.

While beta-particle-emitting radionuclides have been extensively explored for targeted radionuclide therapy, alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides are emerging as effective alternatives. In this context, fundamental understanding of the interactions and dosimetry of these emitted particles with cells in the tumor microenvironment is critical to ascertaining the potential of alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. One important parameter that can be used to assess these metrics is the S-value. In this study, we characterized several alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides (and their associated radionuclide progeny) regarding S-values in the cellular and tumor-metastasis environments. The Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS) was used to obtain S-values via Monte Carlo simulation for cell and tumor metastasis resulting from interactions with the alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides, lead-212 (212Pb), actinium-225 (225Ac) and bismuth-213 (213Bi); these values were compared to the beta-particle-emitting radionuclides yttrium-90 (90Y) and lutetium-177 (177Lu) and an Auger-electron-emitting radionuclide indium-111 (111In). The effect of cellular internalization on S-value was explored at increasing degree of internalization for each radionuclide. This aspect of S-value determination was further explored in a cell line-specific fashion for six different cancer cell lines based on the cell dimensions obtained by confocal microscopy. S-values from PHITS were in good agreement with MIRDcell S-values (cellular S-values) and the values found by Hindié et al. (tumor S-values). In the cellular model, 212Pb and 213Bi decay series produced S-values that were 50- to 120-fold higher than 177Lu, while 225Ac decay series analysis suggested S-values that were 240- to 520-fold higher than 177Lu. S-values arising with 100% cellular internalization were two- to sixfold higher for the nucleus when compared to 0% internalization. The tumor dosimetry model defines the relative merit of radionuclides and suggests alpha particles may be effective for large tumors as well as small tumor metastases. These results from PHITS modeling substantiate emerging evidence that alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides may be an effective alternative to beta-particle-emitting radionuclides for targeted radionuclide therapy due to preferred dose-deposition profiles in the cellular and tumor metastasis context. These results further suggest that internalization of alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides via radiolabeled ligands may increase the relative biological effectiveness of radiotherapeutics. © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",0,,The article focuses on dosimetry modeling for alpha-particle radionuclide therapy using PHITS software but does not explore any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273747574,Potential of a Second-Generation Dual-Layer Spectral CT for Dose Calculation in Particle Therapy Treatment Planning,"In particle therapy treatment planning, dose calculation is conducted using patient-specific maps of tissue ion stopping power ratio (SPR) to predict beam ranges. Improving patient-specific SPR prediction is therefore essential for accurate dose calculation. In this study, we investigated the use of the Spectral CT 7500, a second-generation dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLCT) system, as an alternative to conventional single-energy CT (SECT) for patient-specific SPR prediction. This dual-energy CT (DECT)-based method allows for the direct prediction of SPR from quantitative measurements of relative electron density and effective atomic number using the Bethe equation, whereas the conventional SECT-based method consists of indirect image data-based prediction through the conversion of calibrated CT numbers to SPR. The performance of the Spectral CT 7500 in particle therapy treatment planning was characterized by conducting a thorough analysis of its SPR prediction accuracy for both tissue-equivalent materials and common non-tissue implant materials. In both instances, DLCT was found to reduce uncertainty in SPR predictions compared to SECT. Mean deviations of 0.7% and 1.6% from measured SPR values were found for DLCT- and SECT-based predictions, respectively, in tissue-equivalent materials. Furthermore, end-to-end analyses of DLCT-based treatment planning were performed for proton, helium, and carbon ion therapies with anthropomorphic head and pelvic phantoms. 3D gamma analysis was performed with ionization chamber array measurements as the reference. DLCT-predicted dose distributions revealed higher passing rates compared to SECT-predicted dose distributions.

Volume changes between baseline and the last available follow-up were used to divide patients with partial response, progression of disease and stable disease (PR, PD, and SD). Results: Ten patients were excluded since DWI sequences from baseline MRI were not available. ADC maps obtained from baseline DWI examinations of 50 lesions in the remaining 49 patients were considered. Seven lesions were categorized as PD, 30 PR, and 13 SD. PD showed significantly higher median ADC values at baseline (p = 0.003) compared with both PR and SD (1665vs1253vs1263 *10−6 mm²/s), and more negative skewness values (-0.26vs0.26vs0.08), although not significantly different (p = 0.16). Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that baseline ADC could predict response to treatment with CIRT, particularly to detect potential non-responder patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0,[],The article does not explore any AI methods in carbon ion therapy; it focuses on ADC measurements from MRI for treatment response prediction.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273747578,Imaging-based individualized response prediction of carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients,"Purpose: To explore the value of the pre-treatment MRI radiomic features in individualized prediction of the therapeutic response of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for prostate cancer patients. Patients and methods: Twenty-three patients with localized prostate cancer treated by CIRT were enrolled for analysis. Prostate tumors were manually delineated on T2-weighted (T2w) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps acquired before CIRT. Abundant radiomic features were extracted from the delineations, which were randomly deformed to account for delineation uncertainty. The robust features were selected and then compared between patient groups of different CIRT responses. Support vector machine (SVM) was subsequently applied to demonstrate the role of the radiomic features to predict individualized CIRT response in the way of artificial intelligence. Results: Radiomic features from ADC had significantly higher intra-correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.71±0.28) than T2w features (0.60±0.31) (p<0.01), indicating higher robustness of ADC features against delineation uncertainty. More features were excellently robust in ADC (58.2% of all the radiomic feature candidates, compared to 41.3% in T2w). By combining the excellently robust radiomic features of T2w and ADC, SVM achieved high performance to predict individualized therapeutic response of CIRT, ie, area-under-curve (AUC) = 0.88. Conclusion: Radiomic features extracted from T2w and ADC images displayed great robustness to quantify the tumor characteristics of prostate cancer and high accuracy to predict the individualized therapeutic response of CIRT. After further validation, the selected radiomic features may become potential imaging biomarkers in the management of prostate cancer through CIRT. © 2019 Wu et al.",1,['Support Vector Machine (SVM)'],The article applies AI through radiomic features and SVM to predict therapeutic responses in carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what it's about. The title mentions imaging-based individualized response prediction for carbon ion radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients. That sounds relevant because it involves using imaging and possibly AI techniques to predict how patients will respond to CIRT, which is a form of carbon ion therapy. The purpose section says they're exploring the value of pre-treatment MRI radiomic features for predicting therapeutic responses. Radiomics typically involves extracting a large number of features from medical images, so that's an area where AI could be applied. They used SVM, which stands for Support Vector Machine, a machine learning algorithm. That definitely falls under AI methods. The patients and methods section mentions that they enrolled 23 patients treated with CIRT. They manually delineated tumors on T2-weighted images and ADC maps. Then they extracted radiomic features from these images, accounting for delineation uncertainty by randomly deforming them. This process of feature extraction and handling uncertainty is a common step in AI applications, especially in medical imaging where variability can be high. The results show that ADC features had higher robustness than T2w features, which suggests that certain image types are more reliable for this purpose. They combined the robust features from both T2w and ADC to build an SVM model that achieved an AUC of 0.88, indicating good predictive performance. The conclusion mentions that these radiomic features could become imaging biomarkers for managing prostate cancer with CIRT after further validation. So putting it all together, this article is about applying AI (specifically SVM) using radiomic features from MRI images to predict how individual patients will respond to carbon ion radiotherapy. Since the topic is specifically about applications of AI in carbon ion therapy, this seems directly relevant. The methods used include feature extraction and machine learning modeling with SVM, which are both AI techniques. Therefore, I should select this article by assigning a '1'. The AI method explored here is Support Vector Machine (SVM)."

We investigated the incidence and predictive dosimetric parameters for nasolacrimal duct obstruction following carbon-ion radiotherapy for head and neck tumors. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients with head and neck non-squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed in this single-institution prospective study. More than half of the tumors were located in the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Carbon-ion radiotherapy consisting of 57.6 or 64.0 Gy(relative biological effectiveness; RBE) in 16 fractions was administered. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction was recorded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Cutoff values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. VX indicates the volume irradiated with X Gy(RBE). Results: The median follow-up period was 60.3 months. Incidences of Grade 1 and 2 nasolacrimal duct obstructions were 46% (13/28) and 7% (2/28), respectively; no Grade 3 or greater toxicities were recorded. Throughout the dose range, the volumes of the irradiated nasolacrimal ducts were significantly higher in the obstruction-positive patients than in the obstruction-negative patients (p < 0.001 for V10, V20, V30, V40, V50, and V60). Cutoff values determined by the ROC curve analysis classified the obstruction-positive patients with an accuracy of >96% over the entire range of V10–V60.

From a practical point of view, these models can help clinicians to optimize the radiation absorbed dose delivered to patients in particle therapy. The biophysical model NanOx was recently developed to predict cell survival fractions in the context of radiotherapy. The model takes into account the stochastic nature of radiation at different levels and considers as well the accumulation of radio-induced oxidative stress in cells caused by reactive chemical species. We show in this work how the general formalism of NanOx is adapted to hadrontherapy applications. We then use NanOx to compute the cell survival fractions for three cell lines (V79, CHO-K1 and HSG) in response to carbon ions of different energies, and benchmark the predictions against experimental data. The results attest that NanOx provides a good description of both the overkill effect and the evolution of the shoulders of cell survival curves with linear energy transfer.

rayyan-1273747588,A 64×64 Implantable Real-Time Single-Charged-Particle Radiation Detector for Cancer Therapy,"60% of all cancer treatment requires radiation therapy and the fundamental goal is to deposit sufficient energy in a tumor to irreparably damage its DNA. Unlike high energy photons which pass through the body, charged particles such as protons deposit the majority of their energy at a specific depth, the location of the Bragg peak. In theory, this allows high radiation doses to be delivered in submm proximity to critical organs such as the spinal cord (see Fig. 34.1.1). Unfortunately, mm-scale prediction of the in vivo Bragg peak location is challenging because particle energy loss and scattering are highly path-dependent and patient-specific, largely due to anatomical heterogeneity which drifts from day to day. Given this, clinicians usually reduce therapeutic doses or adjust treatment margins to avoid harming healthy, vital tissue in proximity to the tumor site. To alleviate this constraint, in vivo dosimeters (IVD) have been developed to report in situ radiation doses to clinicians, enabling more effective and safer closed-loop treatment. However, conventional IVDs can only measure the total accumulated energy deposited, i.e. the total dose [1]-[5]. Given this, conventional IVDs cannot distinguish between single high energy particle depositions and those due to the combined contributions from several lower energy depositions, which have significantly different biological effect on tissue [6]. Furthermore, these conventional lVDs employ a single large detector and thus suffers from low spatial resolution. Here, we present a mm-scale real-time single-particle dosimeter array for charged particle cancer therapy that solves these problems. © 2020 IEEE.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273747592,Effects of dose and dose-averaged linear energy transfer on pelvic insufficiency fractures after carbon-ion radiotherapy for uterine carcinoma,"Background and Purpose: The correlation between dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) and its therapeutic or adverse effects, especially in carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LETd and dose on pelvic insufficiency fractures after CIRT. Material and Methods: Among patients who underwent CIRT for uterine carcinoma, 101 who were followed up for > 6 months without any other therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The sacrum insufficiency fractures (SIFs) were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer toxicity criteria. The correlations between the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose, LETd, physical dose, clinical factors, and SIFs were evaluated. In addition, we analyzed the association of SIF with LETd, physical dose, and clinical factors in cases where the sacrum D50% RBE-weighted dose was above the median dose. Results: At the last follow-up, 19 patients developed SIFs. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the sacrum D50% RBE-weighted dose was a valuable predictor of SIF. Univariate analyses suggested that LETd V10 keV/µm, physical dose V5 Gy, and smoking status were associated with SIF. Cox regression analysis in patients over 50 years of age validated that current smoking habit was the sole risk factor for SIF. Therefore, LETd or physical dose parameters were not associated with SIF prediction. Conclusion: The sacrum D50% RBE-weighted dose was identified as a risk factor for SIF. Additionally, neither LETd nor physical dose parameters were associated with SIF prediction. © 2022 The Author(s)",0,,The article does not explore or mention any AI methods; it focuses on evaluating dose and LETd effects on pelvic insufficiency fractures after CIRT without incorporating AI techniques.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. The abstract provided is about a study looking at the effects of dose and LETd (linear energy transfer) on pelvic insufficiency fractures after carbon-ion radiotherapy for uterine carcinoma. Let me break this down step by step to make sure I understand it correctly and can evaluate whether it falls within the scope of AI applications in carbon ion therapy.

First, the title mentions 'Effects of dose and dose-averaged linear energy transfer on pelvic insufficiency fractures after carbon-ion radiotherapy'. So, they're looking at how different doses and LETd levels affect these fractures. The abstract goes into more detail about their methods: they analyzed 101 patients who underwent CIRT for uterine carcinoma, followed up for over six months without other therapies. They looked at SIFs (sacrum insufficiency fractures) using specific grading criteria and evaluated correlations between RBE-weighted dose, LETd, physical dose, clinical factors, and SIFs.

In the results, they found that the sacrum D50% RBE-weighted dose was a valuable predictor of SIF. They also looked at whether LETd or physical dose parameters were associated with SIF prediction but concluded that neither were. Instead, current smoking habit was identified as the sole risk factor for SIF in patients over 50.

Now, considering the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY', I need to see if this article discusses any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy. From reading the abstract, it seems like they're conducting a retrospective analysis of patient data, evaluating various dose metrics and their correlation with SIFs. They used statistical methods like receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, univariate analyses, and Cox regression analysis.

However, there's no mention of any AI techniques such as machine learning algorithms, neural networks, or predictive models that incorporate AI. The study is more about the dosimetric factors affecting treatment outcomes rather than applying AI to improve therapy planning, delivery, or outcome prediction in carbon ion therapy.

Therefore, since the article doesn't explore or apply any AI methods within the context of carbon ion therapy, it doesn't fall under the specified topic. It's a valuable study for understanding dosimetric effects but doesn't contribute to AI applications in this field."

To evaluate patients pain before and after CIRT. To detect if baseline Apparent Diffusion Coefficient values (ADC) from Diffusion Weighted sequences could predict response to treatment. Material and methods: Patients included had one cycle of CIRT and underwent MRI before and after treatment. For each MRI, lesion maximum diameter and volume were obtained, and ADC values were analyzed within the whole lesion volume. Patients pain was evaluated with Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), considering the upper tumor level at baseline MRIs. Results: 39 patients were studied (mean follow-up 18 months). Considering RECIST 1.1 there was not a significant reduction in tumor diameters (p = 0.19), instead there was a significant reduction in tumor volume (p < 0.001), with a significant reduction in pain (p = 0.021) if the tumors were above vertebrae S2–S3 at baseline MRIs. The assessment of baseline ADC maps demonstrated higher median values and more negative skewness values in progressive disease (PD) patients versus both partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD). Conclusions: Lesion volume measurement is more accurate than maximum diameter to better stratify the response of sacral chordoma treated with CIRT.

rayyan-1273747596,Prediction of presence of fastidious bacteria by the Fully Automated Urine Particle Analyzer UF-1000i in the case of ineffective antimicrobial therapy for urinary tract infection,"Introduction: Recent studies have reported associations between fastidious bacteria that are difficult to grow and isolate in conventional urine culture conditions and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Because the Fully Automated Urine Particle Analyzer UF-1000i (hereinafter referred to as “UF-1000i”) detects fastidious bacteria without being affected by culture conditions, owing to its flow cytometry-based principle, we evaluated the robustness of UF-1000i detection using clinical urine samples from patients with UTIs following ineffective antimicrobial therapy. Methods: A total of 150 patients diagnosed with UTIs were enrolled, and their laboratory findings were analyzed, focusing on the discrepancy in bacterial numbers between UF-1000i and conventional culture at each antimicrobial therapy effectiveness classification. In addition, gene identification was conducted by molecular analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to elucidate the reason for the presence of fastidious bacteria in these samples. Results: The ineffective therapy cases showed more than 100-fold discrepancy in bacterial counts, with a higher proportion (30.8%) than effective therapy cases without secondary administration (5.7%) between the bacterial counts in UF-1000i and conventional culture methods. The presence rates of fastidious bacteria were 100% and 66.7% in discrepant cases of ineffective and effective without secondary administrations, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests that discrepancies in bacterial numbers between the conventional culture method and UF-1000i measurement at the primary visit can predict the presence of fastidious bacteria, especially in cases of ineffective antimicrobial therapy. © 2023 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",0,,The article focuses on predicting fastidious bacteria in UTIs using a urine particle analyzer and does not discuss AI applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The results show a significant discrepancy in bacterial numbers between the two methods, particularly in ineffective therapy cases, indicating the presence of fastidious bacteria.

A total of 60 pairs of planning and reviewing four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) sets over 23 patients were used. Method: We constructed an averaged computed tomography (CT) set for each either planning or reviewing 4DCT within respiratory phases between 20% of exhale and inhale. A rigid image registration to align bony structures was performed between planning and reviewing 4DCT. The position changes on top of diaphragm in superior–inferior (SI) direction between 2 CTs to present DM were obtained. The translational vectors in SI from matching to present DLT were obtained. The linear model was built by training data for 23 imaging pairs. A distance model utilized the cumulative probability distribution (CPD) of DM or DLT and was compared with the linear model. We conducted the statistical regression analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) testing data of 37 imaging pairs to validate the performance of our linear model. Results: The DM within 0.5 mm was true positive (TP) with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.983 to predict DLT. The error of predicted DLT within half of its mean value indicated the reliability of prediction method. The 23 pairs of data showed (4.5 ± 3.3) mm for trend of DM and (2.2 ± 1.6) mm for DLT. A linear model of DLT = 0.46*DM + 0.12 was established. The predicted DLT was (2.2 ± 1.5) mm with a prediction error of (0.3 ± 0.3) mm. The accumulated probability of observed and predicted DLT with < 5.0 mm magnitude was 93.2% and 94.5%, respectively. Conclusion: We utilized the linear model to set the proper beam gating for predicting DLT within 5.0 mm to treat patients.

rayyan-1273747599,Commissioning a beam line for MR-guided particle therapy assisted by in silico methods,"Background: Radiation therapy is continuously moving towards more precise dose delivery. The combination of online MR imaging and particle therapy, for example, radiation therapy using protons or carbon ions, could enable the next level of precision in radiotherapy. In particle therapy, research towards a combination of MR and particle therapy is well underway, but still far from clinical systems. The combination of high magnetic fields with particle therapy delivery poses several challenges for treatment planning, treatment workflow, dose delivery, and dosimetry. Purpose: To present a workflow for commissioning of a light ion beam line with an integrated dipole magnet to perform MR-guided particle therapy (MRgPT) research, producing not only basic beam data but also magnetic field maps for accurate dose calculation. Accurate dose calculation in magnetic field environments requires high-quality magnetic field maps to compensate for magnetic-field-dependent trajectory changes and dose perturbations. Methods: The research beam line at MedAustron was coupled with a resistive dipole magnet positioned at the isocenter. Beam data were measured for proton and carbon ions with and without an applied magnetic field of 1 T. Laterally integrated depth-dose curves (IDC) as well as beam profiles were measured in water while beam trajectories were measured in air. Based on manufacturer data, an in silico model of the magnet was created, allowing to extract high-quality 3D magnetic field data. An existing GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo (MC) model of the beam line was extended with the generated magnetic field data and benchmarked against experimental data. Results: A 3D magnetic field volume covering fringe fields until 50 mT was found to be sufficient for an accurate beam trajectory modeling. The effect on particle range retraction was found to be 2.3 and 0.3 mm for protons and carbon ions, respectively. Measured lateral beam offsets in water agreed within 0.4 and −0.5 mm with MC simulations for protons and carbon ions, respectively. Experimentally determined in-air beam trajectories agreed within 0.4 mm in the homogeneous magnetic field area. Conclusion: The presented approach based on in silico modeling and measurements allows to commission a beam line for MRgPT while providing benchmarking data for the magnetic field modeling, required for state-of-the art dose calculation methods. © 2022 The Authors.

rayyan-1273747602,Mixed particle beam for simultaneous treatment and online range verification in carbon ion therapy: Proof-of-concept study,"Purpose: Radiation therapy with ion beams provides a better conformation and effectiveness of the dose delivered to the tumor with respect to photon beams. This implies that a small uncertainty or variation in the crossed tissue shape and density may lead to a more important underdosage of the tumor and/or an overdosage of the surrounding healthy tissue. Although the online control of beam fluence and transverse position is well managed by an appropriate beam delivery system, the online measurement of the longitudinal position of the Bragg peak inside the patient is still an open issue. In this paper we propose a proof-of-concept study of a technique that would allow the online verification of the patient thickness along the beam direction, which could permit detecting a subset of possible range error causes, such as morphological variations. Methods: The nuclei 12C and 4He have the same magnetic rigidity: the two species could be accelerated together in an accelerator and a mixed particle beam delivered to the patient. In the same medium and with the same energy per nucleon, the range of 4He2+ is about three times the 12C6+ one. It is, thus, conceivable to achieve a dual goal with a single mixed beam: carbon, stopping into the tumor, is appointed to cure, while helium, emerging from the patient, to control: by detecting and measuring the residual range and position of He, it would be possible to determine the integrated relative stopping power of the patient and prove that it is the expected one. For the detection of helium particles, a plastic scintillator and an optical sensor are proposed. Being helium ions not available at CNAO, the detection system has been characterized using a proton beam. Nevertheless, since the light emitted by a proton is less than the one produced by a helium ion, the helium signal is expected to be more pronounced than the proton one (for the same number of particles). To predict the magnitude of the light signal measured by the sensor, two Monte Carlo models have been setup and validated by measuring the photons per pixel impinging on the sensor. To deal with the many optical issues and to reliably describe the physical process, some corrections have been included into the models. Results: The predictions of both the models are in good agreement with the measurements (within the 20% in terms of absolute photons per pixel). The proposed detection system is able to measure the range of a proton beam with sub-millimetrical precision also in the presence of the background produced by carbon ion fragments and discrepancies in the expected range were detected with a resolution better than 1 mm. Conclusions: Although many technical issues have still to be addressed for a real implementation in a clinical environment, the preliminary results of this study suggest that a surrogate of real-time verification of the beam range inside the patient during a treatment with carbon ions is possible by adding a small fraction of helium ions to the primary beam. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",0,,The article does not mention the use of AI methods; it focuses on a mixed particle beam technique for range verification in carbon ion therapy without incorporating artificial intelligence techniques.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Methods: The study was conducted on the anthropomorphic phantom and head-and-neck patients. We collected computed tomography (CT) and DR images of the phantom and cone beam CT (CBCT) and DR images of the patients, respectively. Two different deep neural networks were established to correlate the relationships between DR and digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) images, as well as DRR and CT images. The similarity between CT and predicted CT images was evaluated by computing the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM), respectively. Dose calculations on the predicted CT images were compared against the true CT-based dose distributions for carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning with intensity-modulated pencil-beam spot scanning. Relative dose differences in the target volumes and organ-at-risks were computed and three-dimensional gamma analyses (3 mm, 3%) were performed. Results: The average MAE, RMSE, PSNR and SSIM of the framework were 0.007, 0.144, 37.496 and 0.973, respectively. The average relative dose differences between the predicted CT- and CT-based dose distributions at the same carbon-ion irradiation settings for the phantom and the patients were <2% and ≤4%, respectively. The average gamma pass-rates were >98% for the predicted CT-based versus CT-based carbon ion plans of the phantom and the patients.

The title mentions using deep learning for treatment planning in carbon-ion radiotherapy, which immediately sounds relevant because it's applying an AI method (deep learning) to a specific area of therapy (carbon ion). The purpose section explains that they're evaluating the feasibility of patient-specific DR-only treatment planning. They used two different deep neural networks to correlate relationships between DR and DRR images, as well as DRR and CT images. This definitely involves AI methods since they're using deep learning models. The results show good accuracy in predicting CT images from DR data, which is crucial for treatment planning without needing CT scans. The conclusion confirms the feasibility of this approach, showing that it's effective. Since the study applies AI (specifically deep neural networks) to improve carbon ion therapy treatment planning, it fits perfectly within the topic scope. Therefore, I should select this article and list the AI methods used."

The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate preliminary results of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in patients with axial bone and soft tissue sarcomas (BSTS) treated with curative intent at the National Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO). Patients and Methods: From January 2013 to September 2018, 54 patients with axial BSTS were treated with CIRT at CNAO. Their median age was 50 years (range=19-79 years), males/females=1.4:1. Tumor site was the pelvis in 50% of cases (n=27), thoracic region in 24% (n=13), cervical spine in 15% (n=8) and lumbar in 11% (n=6). A total of 76% (n=41) of patients had primary disease, while 24% (n=13) had recurrent disease. Before CIRT, surgery was performed in 47% of cases, including positive margins (R1) in 8 patients, and macroscopic residual disease (R2) in 17. Histological subtypes were mainly represented by chondrosarcomas in 39% (n=21) of patients and osteosarcomas in 24% (n=13). Pre-treatment chemotherapy was administered in 40% of cases (n=22); no patient received previous radiotherapy. All treatments were performed with active scanning CIRT for a median total dose of 73.6 Gy (range=70.4-76.8 Gy), in 16 fractions (4 fractions per week). Results: Median follow-up was 24 months (range=4-61 months). Four patients were lost to follow-up. Acute toxicities were mild, no >G2 event was reported and no treatment interruption was required. For late toxicity, only G3 neuropathy was detected in 4% of cases (n=2). With a median time to local progression of 13 months (3-35), 15 local failures were observed, resulting in 2- and 3-year local control rates of 67.4% for both. Distant progression occurred in 12 patients, with 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 97.5%; 2- and 3-year rates were 92.2%. Fifteen patients died resulting in 1- 2- and 3-years overall survival (OS) rates of 87.1%, 75.4% and 64%, respectively. At log-rank test, gross total volume (GTV) >1,000 ml was found to be predictive of local failure (p=0.04), pre-treatment chemotherapy was found to be significantly related to PFS and OS (p=0.02 and p=0.016); also, recurrent disease and distant progression were significantly related to OS (p=0.019 and p=0.0013). Cox proportional-hazards model confirmed that GTV >1,000 ml was related to worse local control (p=0.0010).

rayyan-1273747609,Deep learning-based fast denoising of Monte Carlo dose calculation in carbon ion radiotherapy,"Background: Plan verification is one of the important steps of quality assurance (QA) in carbon ion radiotherapy. Conventional methods of plan verification are based on phantom measurement, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Although the plan verification method based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation provides a more accurate modeling of the physics, it is also time-consuming when simulating with a large number of particles. Therefore, how to ensure the accuracy of simulation results while reducing simulation time is the current difficulty and focus. Purpose: The purpose of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of using deep learning-based MC denoising method to accelerate carbon-ion radiotherapy plan verification. Methods: Three models, including CycleGAN, 3DUNet and GhostUNet with Ghost module, were used to denoise the 1 × 106 carbon ions-based MC dose distribution to the accuracy of 1 × 108 carbon ions-based dose distribution. The CycleGAN's generator, 3DUNet and GhostUNet were all derived from the 3DUNet network. A total of 59 cases including 29 patients with head-and-neck cancers and 30 patients with lung cancers were collected, and 48 cases were randomly selected as the training set of the CycleGAN network and six cases as the test set. For the 3DUNet and GhostUNet models, the numbers of training set, validation set, and test set were 47, 6, and 6, respectively. Finally, the three models were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using RMSE and three-dimensional gamma analysis (3 mm, 3%). Results: The three end-to-end trained models could be used for denoising the 1 × 106 carbon ions-based dose distribution, and their generalization was proved. The GhostUNet obtained the lowest RMSE value of 0.075, indicating the smallest difference between its denoised and 1 × 108 carbon ions-based dose distributions. The average gamma passing rate (GPR) between the GhostUNet denoising-based versus 1 × 108 carbon ions-based dose distributions was 99.1%, higher than that of the CycleGAN at 94.3% and the 3DUNet at 96.2%. Among the three models, the GhostUNet model had the fewest parameters (4.27 million) and the shortest training time (99 s per epoch) but achieved the best denoising results. Conclusion: The end-to-end deep network GhostUNet outperforms the CycleGAN, 3DUNet models in denoising MC dose distributions for carbon ion radiotherapy. The network requires less than 5 s to denoise a sample of MC simulation with few particles to obtain a qualitative and quantitative result comparable to the dose distribution simulated by MC with relatively large number particles, offering a significant reduction in computation time. © 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",1,"['CycleGAN', '3DUNet', 'GhostUNet']","The article presents an original research on applying deep learning models (CycleGAN, 3DUNet, GhostUNet) to accelerate Monte Carlo dose calculations in carbon ion radiotherapy, which falls within the scope of AI applications in this therapy.","Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what it's about. The title mentions deep learning-based fast denoising of Monte Carlo dose calculation in carbon ion radiotherapy. That sounds relevant because it involves AI (deep learning) applied specifically to a therapy method, which is carbon ion therapy here. The background talks about plan verification being important for quality assurance in this type of therapy. They mention that conventional methods are time-consuming and that MC simulations are accurate but also time-consuming when using many particles. So the problem they're addressing is how to reduce simulation time without losing accuracy. Their purpose is to evaluate a deep learning-based method for denoising MC dose distributions, which would help in accelerating plan verification. The methods section lists three models: CycleGAN, 3DUNet, and GhostUNet with a Ghost module. All of these are AI models used for denoising. They tested these models on various cases involving head-and-neck and lung cancer patients. The results show that GhostUNet performed the best in terms of RMSE and gamma passing rate, which indicates better accuracy. It also had fewer parameters and faster training time compared to the other models. The conclusion emphasizes that GhostUNet outperformed the others and significantly reduced computation time. So this article is definitely about applying AI (specifically deep learning models) to improve a specific aspect of carbon ion therapy—plan verification through dose calculation denoising. It fits well within the topic scope because it's an original research article demonstrating how AI can be used in this medical application. I don't see any signs that it's a review article; it describes their methods, results, and conclusions from their own study. Therefore, it should be selected with a '1'.

rayyan-1273747616,Prediction model of critical weight loss in cancer patients during particle therapy,"Background and purpose: The objective of this study is to investigate the predictors of critical weight loss in cancer patients receiving particle therapy, and build a prediction model based on its predictive factors. Materials and methods: Patients receiving particle therapy were enroled between June 2015 and June 2016. Body weight was measured at the start and end of particle therapy. Association between critical weight loss (defined as > 5%) during particle therapy and patients' demographic, clinical characteristic, pre-therapeutic nutrition risk screening (NRS 2002) and BMI were evaluated by logistic regression and decision tree analysis. Results: Finally, 375 cancer patients receiving particle therapy were included. Mean weight loss was 0.55 kg, and 11.5% of patients experienced critical weight loss during particle therapy. The main predictors of critical weight loss during particle therapy were head and neck tumour location, total radiation dose ≥70 Gy on the primary tumour, and without post-surgery, as indicated by both logistic regression and decision tree analysis. Prediction model that includes tumour locations, total radiation dose and post-surgery had a good predictive ability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.88) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.86) for decision tree and logistic regression model, respectively. Conclusions: Cancer patients with head and neck tumour location, total radiation dose ≥70 Gy and without post-surgery were at higher risk of critical weight loss during particle therapy, and early intensive nutrition counselling or intervention should be target at this population. © The Author 2017.

All rights reserved.",0,,The study uses logistic regression and decision tree analysis but does not explicitly apply AI methods to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if the given abstract falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully. The title is about a prediction model for critical weight loss in cancer patients during particle therapy. Particle therapy can include various types like proton or carbon ion therapy, but it's not specified here. The methods used are logistic regression and decision tree analysis. These are statistical methods commonly used in AI, especially in predictive modeling. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention AI techniques beyond these basic models. It also doesn't specify if the particle therapy is specifically carbon ion therapy or another type. Since the topic is about applications of AI in carbon ion therapy, and this study might not be focused on that specific modality, I'm leaning towards it not being selected. But wait, maybe the methods used are considered AI? Logistic regression isn't typically classified as AI; it's more of a traditional statistical method. Decision trees can be part of machine learning, which is under AI. However, without explicit mention of AI or carbon ion therapy, it might not fit the scope precisely. So, I think this should be marked as 0 because while there are some predictive models, they don't specifically fall under AI applications in carbon ion therapy."
rayyan-1273747617,Recent Advancements of Artificial Intelligence in Particle Therapy,"We are in a golden age of progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Radiotherapy is perfectly suited to benefit from AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency due to its technology-intensive nature and direct human-machine interactions. While large amount of AI research have recently been published in the field of photon therapy, applications of AI specifically targeted for particle therapy remain scarcely investigated. There are two distinct differences between the photon therapy and particle therapy: 1) beam interaction physics (photons versus charged particles) and 2) beam delivery mode (e.g., IMRT/VMAT versus pencil beam scanning). Consequently, different strategies of AI deployment are required for these two radiotherapy modalities. In this article, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of recent literature exclusively focusing on AI-powered particle therapy. Six major aspects are included: 1) treatment planning; 2) dose calculation; 3) range and dose verification; 4) image guidance; 5) quality assurance; and 6) adaptive replanning. A number of perspectives, as well as potential challenges and common pitfalls, are also discussed.  © 2017 IEEE.",1,['Not explicitly listed in the abstract.'],"The article discusses AI applications in particle therapy, which includes carbon ion therapy, covering treatment planning, dose calculation, range verification, image guidance, quality assurance, and adaptive replanning.","Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what it's about. The title mentions recent advancements of AI in particle therapy, which sounds relevant because carbon ion therapy falls under particle therapy. The content talks about how radiotherapy can benefit from AI, specifically mentioning that while photon therapy has a lot of AI research, particle therapy hasn't been explored as much. It points out the differences between photon and particle therapy, like beam interaction physics and delivery modes, which makes sense because carbon ions are charged particles and have different delivery methods compared to photons. The article then goes on to discuss six major aspects where AI is applied in particle therapy: treatment planning, dose calculation, range and dose verification, image guidance, quality assurance, and adaptive replanning. It also mentions discussing perspectives, challenges, and pitfalls. Now, the key here is whether this article specifically addresses carbon ion therapy or if it's more general about particle therapy. The abstract doesn't explicitly mention carbon ions; it just refers to particle therapy in general. However, since carbon ion therapy is a type of particle therapy, maybe the applications discussed could still be relevant. But I'm not sure if the article focuses solely on carbon ions or includes other types like protons as well. If it's a comprehensive survey of AI in all forms of particle therapy without specifically targeting carbon ions, then it might not fit the topic exactly. The user is looking for articles that are about AI applications specifically in carbon ion therapy. So if this article doesn't narrow down to carbon ions but talks about particle therapy as a whole, including maybe protons and others, then it wouldn't be selected. But I'm not entirely certain because sometimes 'particle therapy' can include carbon ions. Maybe the user considers all particle therapies under their topic, in which case this would be relevant. Alternatively, if they're looking for articles that specifically mention or focus on carbon ion therapy, then without explicit mention, it might not qualify. The abstract does say it's a comprehensive survey focusing exclusively on AI-powered particle therapy, but doesn't specify the type of particles. So I'm leaning towards selecting it because it's about AI in particle therapy, which includes carbon ions, even if it's not explicitly stated. But to be precise, since the topic is specifically about carbon ion therapy, maybe it's better to exclude articles that don't mention it directly unless they clearly include it under their scope. I'm a bit confused here because the article doesn't specify carbon ions but talks about particle therapy in general. Maybe I should look for any keywords related to carbon ions or if the methods discussed are applicable to them. The six aspects mentioned—treatment planning, dose calculation, etc.—are relevant to any particle therapy, including carbon ions. So perhaps it's still within scope because even though it doesn't mention carbon ions by name, the applications would apply there as well. Alternatively, maybe the user wants articles that specifically discuss carbon ion therapy, so without explicit mention, it might not be selected. I think the safest approach is to select it since particle therapy includes carbon ions, and the article discusses AI applications in that broader category. Therefore, I'll mark it as selected with a 1."

rayyan-1273747620,Evaluating normal tissue damage after hadrontherapy by chromosome aberration prediction,"In cancer hadrontherapy, the Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) is calculated by considering cell survival as the endpoint of interest. Although this is a good estimator of the beam effectiveness in eliminating the tumour cells, late damage in healthy tissues, including secondary tumours, is better correlated with chromosomal aberrations. In particular, dicentrics in blood lymphocytes are widely considered as a good biomarker of normal tissue damage, as the blood circulates in all tissues and is inevitably exposed to radiation during the treatment. In this study, lymphocyte dicentrics were used as an ad hoc endpoint to evaluate the RBE for (late) normal tissue damage by means of BIANCA (BIophysical ANalysis of Cell death and chromosome Aberrations), a biophysical model that simulates radiation-induced chromosome aberrations and cell death. More specifically, BIANCA was applied to produce a radiobiological database that predicts lymphocyte dicentric induction as a function of dose, particle type and LET. Afterwards, an interface with the FLUKA code allowed predicting dicentric RBE along a C-ion SOBP, and comparing it with cell survival RBE. This pilot study suggested that using the RBE for tumour cell survival along the entire beam might lead to an underestimation of the risk of normal tissue damage. © 2020 Societa Italiana di Fisica.

The conclusion suggests that using RBE for tumor cell survival might underestimate normal tissue damage risk. Now, the key point is whether AI methods are involved here.

Patients received FLT-PET/CT scan one-week prior to or after completion of CIRT were enrolled in the study. All patients were from prospective trials or treated using a standardized protocol. Time-dependent receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were used to determine the optimal cutoff values for FLT-PET parameters. Univariable and multivariable analyses of local progression-free survival (LPFS) were performed using Cox regression, to examine the prognostic value of FLT-PET parameters, including SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion thymidine (TLT). A total of 41 patients were enrolled. Elevated MTV and TLT were significantly associated with worse LPFS, in both univariable and multivariable analyses. ROC analysis revealed that both an MTV value higher than 8.6 and a TLT value higher than 14.9 were predictive of increased risk of developing local recurrence, the adjusted HRs were 5.59 (p=0.009) and 7.76 (p=0.002), respectively.

Results: An inter-centre variation in SPR prediction (2σ) of 8.7%, 6.3% and 1.5% relative to water was determined for bone, lung and soft-tissue surrogates in the head setup, respectively. Slightly smaller variations were observed in the body phantom (6.2%, 3.1%, 1.3%). This translated into inter-centre variation of integral range prediction (2σ) of 2.9%, 2.6% and 1.3% for typical beam paths of prostate-, lung- and primary brain-tumour treatments, respectively. The absolute error in range exceeded 2% in every fourth participating centre. The consideration of beam hardening and the execution of an independent HLUT validation had a positive effect, on average. Conclusion: The large inter-centre variations in SPR and range prediction justify the currently clinically used margins accounting for range uncertainty, which are of the same magnitude as the inter-centre variation.

rayyan-1273747632,Inter-centre variability of CT-based stopping-power prediction in particle therapy: Survey-based evaluation,"Background and purpose: Stopping-power ratios (SPRs) are used in particle therapy to calculate particle range in patients. The heuristic CT-to-SPR conversion (Hounsfield Look-Up-Table, HLUT), needed for treatment planning, depends on CT-scan and reconstruction parameters as well as the specific HLUT definition. To assess inter-centre differences in these parameters, we performed a survey-based qualitative evaluation, as a first step towards better standardisation of CT-based SPR derivation. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to twelve particle therapy centres (ten from Europe and two from USA). It asked for details on CT scanners, image acquisition and reconstruction, definition of the HLUT, body-region specific HLUT selection, investigations of beam-hardening and experimental validations of the HLUT. Technological improvements were rated regarding their potential to improve SPR accuracy. Results: Scan parameters and HLUT definition varied widely. Either the stoichiometric method (eight centres) or a tissue-substitute-only HLUT definition (three centres) was used. One centre combined both methods. The number of HLUT line segments varied widely between two and eleven. Nine centres had investigated influence of beam-hardening, often including patient-size dependence. Ten centres had validated their HLUT experimentally, with very different validation schemes. Most centres deemed dual-energy CT promising for improving SPR accuracy. Conclusions: Large inter-centre variability was found in implementation of CT scans, image reconstruction and especially in specification of the CT-to-SPR conversion. A future standardisation would reduce time-intensive institution-specific efforts and variations in treatment quality. Due to the interdependency of multiple parameters, no conclusion can be drawn on the derived SPR accuracy and its inter-centre variability. © 2018 The Authors",0,,The article focuses on inter-centre variability and standardization of CT-based stopping-power prediction but does not explore any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Accurate knowledge of the stopping power ratio (SPR) distribution of the tissues in the patient is crucial for improving dose prediction in patients during planning. However, materials of uncertain stoichiometric composition such as dental implant and restoration materials can substantially impair particle therapy treatment planning due to related SPR prediction uncertainties. This study investigated the impact of using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) imaging for characterizing and compensating for commonly used dental implant and restoration materials during particle therapy treatment planning. Radiological material parameters of ten common dental materials were determined using two different DECT techniques: sequential acquisition CT (SACT) and dual-layer spectral CT (DLCT). DECT-based direct SPR predictions of dental materials via spectral image data were compared to conventional single-energy CT (SECT)-based SPR predictions obtained via indirect CT-number-to-SPR conversion. DECT techniques were found overall to reduce uncertainty in SPR predictions in dental implant and restoration materials compared to SECT, although DECT methods showed limitations for materials containing elements of a high atomic number. To assess the influence on treatment planning, an anthropomorphic head phantom with a removable tooth containing lithium disilicate as a dental material was used. The results indicated that both DECT techniques predicted similar ranges for beams unobstructed by dental material in the head phantom. When ion beams passed through the lithium disilicate restoration, DLCT-based SPR predictions using a projection-based method showed better agreement with measured reference SPR values (range deviation: 0.2 mm) compared to SECT-based predictions. DECT-based SPR prediction may improve the management of certain non-tissue dental implant and restoration materials and subsequently increase dose prediction accuracy. © 2023 The Authors.

So, it's talking about using DECT (Dual-Energy Computed Tomography) to predict stopping power ratios (SPR) for dental materials used in particle therapy. Particle therapy includes proton and light ion therapies, which are mentioned in the abstract as well. The study compares two DECT techniques: SACT and DLCT, against SECT (Single-Energy CT). They found that DECT reduces uncertainty in SPR predictions compared to SECT but has limitations with high atomic number materials. They tested this using a head phantom with lithium disilicate dental material. The results showed better agreement with reference values for DLCT-based methods. So, the article is about improving stopping power prediction accuracy using DECT techniques in particle therapy, specifically addressing issues with dental materials that can affect treatment planning. Now, looking at the topic: 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY.' The abstract doesn't mention anything about artificial intelligence methods or carbon ions specifically.

This prospective study analyzed 61 patients with inoperable BSTS who were treated with CIRT to evaluate QOL, functional outcomes, and predictive factors in patients with inoperable BSTS treated with definitive CIRT. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system and the Short Form (SF)‐8 questionnaire were completed before and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after CIRT. The median follow‐up period was 38 months. The main site of primary disease was the pelvis (70.5%), and the most common pathologic diagnosis was chordoma (45.9%). The 3‐year overall survival and local control rates were 87.8% and 83.8%, respectively. The MSTS score and physical component score (PCS) of SF‐8 did not change significantly between the baseline and subsequent values. The mental component score of SF‐8 significantly improved after CIRT. Multivariate analysis showed that the normalized MSTS and normalized PCS of SF‐8 at the final follow‐up were significantly affected by performance status at diagnosis and sex. CIRT showed clinical efficacy, preserving the physical component of QOL and functional outcomes and improving the mental component of QOL, suggesting its potential value for the treatment of patients with inoperable BSTS. © 2021 by the authors.

Additionally, a comparison study of carbon ions versus protons is performed considering current best solutions in commercial TPS. Methods: All treatment plans were optimized and calculated using the RayStation TPS (RaySearch, Sweden). The dose distributions calculated with the TPS were compared with measurements using a 24-pinpoint ionization chamber array (T31015, PTW, Germany). Tissue-like inhomogeneities (bone, lung, and soft tissue) were embedded in water, while a target volume of 4 x 4 x 4 cm3 was defined at two different depths behind the heterogeneities. In total, 10 different test cases, with and without range shifter as well as different air gaps, were investigated. Dose distributions inside as well as behind the target volume were evaluated. Results: Inside the target volume, the mean dose difference between calculations and measurements, averaged over all test cases, was 1.6% for carbon ions. This compares well to the final agreement of 1.5% obtained in water at the commissioning stage of the TPS for carbon ions and is also within the clinically acceptable interval of 3%. The mean dose difference and maximal dose difference obtained outside the target area were 1.8% and 13.4%, respectively. The agreement of dose distributions for carbon ions in the target volumes was comparable or better to that between Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations and measurements for protons. Percentage dose differences of more than 10% were present outside the target area behind bone–lung structures, where the carbon ion calculations systematically over predicted the dose. MC dose calculations for protons were superior to carbon ion beams outside the target volumes. Conclusion: The pencil beam dose calculations for carbon ions in RayStation were found to be in good agreement with dosimetric measurements in heterogeneous geometries for points of interest located within the target. Large local discrepancies behind the target may contribute to incorrect dose predictions for organs at risk. © 2021 The Authors.

The present study analyzed the preliminary clinical outcomes of CIRT for prostate cancer. Methods: The clinical outcomes of 253 patients with prostate cancer who were treated with CIRT delivered using the spot scanning method between December 2015 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The irradiation dose was set at 51.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) delivered in 12 fractions over 3 weeks. Biochemical relapse was defined using the Phoenix definition. Toxicities were assessed according to CTCAE version 4.0. Results: The median patient age was 70 (47-86) years. The median follow-up duration was 35.3 (4.1-52.9) months.

rayyan-1273747647,Pre-clinical evaluation of dual-layer spectral computed tomography-based stopping power prediction for particle therapy planning at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center,"Accurate beam range prediction during clinical treatment planning is key to improve targeted dose delivery in proton and heavy ion therapy. A substantial source of beam range uncertainty is the prediction of ion stopping power ratio (SPR) relative to water from an empirical calibration based on conventional x-ray computed tomography (CT) used in clinical practice today. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a novel spectral CT imaging technique based on a dual-layer detector-based approach to improve the SPR prediction for particle therapy treatment planning, an improvement that would minimize the beam range uncertainty and allow for reduced safety margins in the patient. Using calibrated and validated maps of electron density and effective atomic number from spectral CT data, predicted SPR values in tissue substitutes were within a mean accuracy of 0.6% compared to measured SPR and showed substantially better agreement with measured data compared to standard CT-number-to-SPR calibration. The accuracy of SPR was not affected by CT acquisition settings, reconstruction parameters, phantom size, and type. Additionally, various spectral CT conversion algorithms were compared to determine the most accurate prediction method. Dosimetric validation of the developed method using a half-head anthropomorphic phantom in a routine-like setting indicated that SPR prediction with dual-layer spectral CT outperforms the clinical single-energy CT standard with a range prediction improvement of 1 mm.

A recent initiative was launched for establishing the South-East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies (SEEIIST), a pan European research infrastructure (RI) which will provide a cutting-edge technology for (a) radiotherapy treatment with accelerated protons and ions and (b) multidisciplinary fundamental research involving accelerated ion beams. To justify the initiative for building the SEEIIST facility for cancer treatment, a study was conducted to estimate the time progress of the cancer incidence and mortality due to cancer in the countries of the SEE region. Methods and materials. The demography and the economic development of the SEE region were studied in relation to their emigration rate (brain drain). Time development of the incidence and mortality were studied for the SEE countries from the data available at Globocan of the IARC@WHO. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries' cancer datasheets from the World Health Organization (WHO). The top ten cancers were presented for the SEE countries and for the region as a whole. Results. From the available data it is evident that the incidence and the mortality, both grow with time in the SEE region, unlike in the developed European countries chosen for reference, where the mortality declines with time. The occurrence of breaking points in curves mortality vs. time is evident for all the analyzed SEE countries. Many of these points coincide with changes in the societal aspects (security, politics and/or economy). Conclusion. The emerging research infrastructure SEEIIST will mitigate the brain drain from SEE, and contribute in overcoming the historical friction in the turbulent Balkan region, offering research opportunities in many fields related to accelerated ions, foster, research, innovation and knowledge transfer, facilitate radiational therapy with particles to the cancer patients of the SEE region, reducing the growing cancer mortality, thereby. SEEIIST will be developed as a strong commitment of the SEE countries' governments and common effort in science diplomacy of the international community.

rayyan-1273747654,Biological and clinical significance of radiomics features obtained from magnetic resonance imaging preceding pre-carbon ion radiotherapy in prostate cancer based on radiometabolomics,"Introduction: We aimed to investigate the feasibility of metabolomics to explain the underlying biological implications of radiomics features obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preceding carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in patients with prostate cancer and to further explore the clinical significance of radiomics features on the prognosis of patients, based on their biochemical recurrence (BCR) status. Methods: Metabolomic results obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry of urine samples, combined with pre-RT radiomic features extracted from MRI images, were evaluated to investigate their biological significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was subsequently conducted to examine the correlation between these biological implications and clinical BCR status. Statistical and metabolic pathway analyses were performed using MetaboAnalyst and R software. Results: Correlation analysis revealed that methionine alteration extent was significantly related to four radiomic features (Contrast, Difference Variance, Small Dependence High Gray Level Emphasis, and Mean Absolute Deviation), which were significantly correlated with BCR status. The area under the curve (AUC) for BCR prediction of these four radiomic features ranged from 0.704 to 0.769, suggesting that the higher the value of these four radiomic features, the greater the decrease in methionine levels after CIRT and the lower the probability of BCR. Pre-CIRT MRI radiomic features were associated with CIRT-suppressed metabolites. Discussion: These radiomic features can be used to predict the alteration in the amplitude of methionine after CIRT and the BCR status, which may contribute to the optimization of the CIRT strategy and deepen the understanding of PCa.

High energy proton beam therapy commenced in the UK National Health Service in 2018. Heavier charged particles have potential advantages over protons by delivering more dose in the Bragg peak, with a sharper penumbra, lower oxygen dependence and increased biological effectiveness. However, they also require more costly equipment including larger gantries to deliver the treatment. There are significant uncertainties in the modelling of relative biological effectiveness and the effects of the fragmentation tail which can deliver dose beyond the Bragg peak. These effects need to be carefully considered especially in relation to long-term outcomes. In 2019, a group of clinicians, clinical scientists, engineers, physical and life scientists from academia and industry, together with funding agency stakeholders, met to consider how the UK should address new technologies for RT, especially the use of heavier charged particles such as helium and carbon and new modes of delivery such as FLASH and spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT). There was unanimous agreement that the UK should develop a facility for heavier charged particle therapy, perhaps constituting a new National Ion Research Centre to enable research using protons and heavier charged particles. Discussion followed on the scale and features, including which ions should be included, from protons through helium, boron, and lithium to carbon, and even oxygen. The consensus view was that any facility intended to treat patients must be located in a hospital setting while providing dedicated research space for physics, preclinical biology and clinical research with beam lines designed for both in vitro and in vivo research. The facility should to be able to investigate and deliver both ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT and SFRT (GRID, minibeams etc.). Discussion included a number of accelerator design options and whether gantries were required. Other potential collaborations might be exploited, including with space agencies, electronics and global communications industries and the nuclear industry. In preparation for clinical delivery, there may be opportunities to send patients overseas (for 12C or 4He ion therapy) using the model of the National Health Service (NHS) Proton Overseas Programme and to look at potential national clinical trials which include heavier ions, FLASH or SFRT. This could be accomplished under the auspices of NCRI CTRad (National Cancer Research Institute, Clinical and Translational Radiotherapy Research Working Group). The initiative should be a community approach, involving all interested parties with a vision that combines discovery science, a translational research capability and a clinical treatment facility. Barriers to the project and ways to overcome them were discussed.

rayyan-1273747657,Particle Swarm Optimisation Applied to the Direct Aperture Optimisation Problem in Radiation Therapy,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is one of the most used techniques for cancer treatment. Using a linear accelerator, it delivers radiation directly at the cancerogenic cells in the tumour, reducing the impact of the radiation on the organs surrounding the tumour. The complexity of the IMRT problem forces researchers to subdivide it into three sub-problems that are addressed sequentially. Using this sequential approach, we first need to find a beam angle configuration that will be the set of irradiation points (beam angles) over which the tumour radiation is delivered. This first problem is called the Beam Angle Optimisation (BAO) problem. Then, we must optimise the radiation intensity delivered from each angle to the tumour. This second problem is called the Fluence Map Optimisation (FMO) problem. Finally, we need to generate a set of apertures for each beam angle, making the intensities computed in the previous step deliverable. This third problem is called the Sequencing problem. Solving these three sub-problems sequentially allows clinicians to obtain a treatment plan that can be delivered from a physical point of view. However, the obtained treatment plans generally have too many apertures, resulting in long delivery times. One strategy to avoid this problem is the Direct Aperture Optimisation (DAO) problem. In the DAO problem, the idea is to merge the FMO and the Sequencing problem. Hence, optimising the radiation’s intensities considers the physical constraints of the delivery process. The DAO problem is usually modelled as a Mixed-Integer optimisation problem and aims to determine the aperture shapes and their corresponding radiation intensities, considering the physical constraints imposed by the Multi-Leaf Collimator device. In solving the DAO problem, generating clinically acceptable treatments without additional sequencing steps to deliver to the patients is possible. In this work, we propose to solve the DAO problem using the well-known Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. Our approach integrates the use of mathematical programming to optimise the intensities and utilizes PSO to optimise the aperture shapes. Additionally, we introduce a reparation heuristic to enhance aperture shapes with minimal impact on the treatment plan. We apply our proposed algorithm to prostate cancer cases and compare our results with those obtained in the sequential approach.

Precisely, these involve radiotherapy and chemotherapy in a concurrent or adjuvant manner together with anti-angiogenic therapy affecting the vascular component of the system. We assess tumor growth and spread on the basis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, which allows us to reconstruct a realistic brain geometry and tissue structure, and we apply our model to real glioma patient data.

rayyan-1273747660,A hybrid numerical approach to the propagation of charged particle beams through matter for hadron therapy beamline simulations,"In hadron therapy beamlines, passive elements are used to reduce the beam energy or to shape its transverse profile and frequently complement the magnetic transport channel elements. In particular, cyclotron-based facilities feature energy degraders to tailor the energy to the treatment value. As such, the numerical modeling of hadron therapy beamlines is crucially reliant on the accuracy of the available beam–matter interaction models to simulate the beam properties at levels suitable for clinical applications. While integrated Monte Carlo codes reach these accuracy levels, ultra-fast numerical codes are essential for beam commissioning controls applications or fast iterative optimization of new designs. To that end, we propose a novel effective model to compute the beam–matter interactions in a hybrid fashion, using tabulated range tables, the semi-analytical Fermi–Eyges approximation, and fits extracted from Monte Carlo data. In this work, we detail the method and benchmark each step with Geant4 simulations. Finally, we validate its accuracy with beam-based measurements from a proton therapy facility using our Python-language implementation which is shown to provide computation time of the order of milliseconds.

Methods: We analysed 1027 patients enrolled between January 2015 and December 2017 and followed up for 24 months. Four hundred and twenty-two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 120 with intrahepatic carcinoma (ICC), 237 with colorectal liver metastases and 248 with liver metastases from other primaries were included. Prognostic factors were calculated with a univariable analysis by using the overall AEs burden score (AEBS). Results: All-cause AEs were reported in 401/1027 (39.1%) patients, with AEs associated with TARE, such as abdominal pain (16.6%), fatigue (17%), and nausea (11.7%) reported most frequently. Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 92/1027 (9%) patients. Reports on grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal ulcerations (0.4%), gastritis (0.3%), radiation cholecystitis (0.2%) or radioembolization-induced liver disease (0.5%) were uncommon. Univariable analysis showed that in HCC, AEBS increased for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 (p = 0.0045), 1 tumour nodule (0.0081), > 1 TARE treatment (p = 0.0224), no prophylactic embolization (p = 0.0211), partition model dosimetry (p = 0.0007) and unilobar treatment target (0.0032).

rayyan-1273747663,Particle filter de-noising of voxel-specific time-activity-curves in personalized 177Lu therapy,"Background: Currently, there is a high interest in 177Lu targeted radionuclide therapies, which could be attributed to favorable results obtained from 177Lu compounds targeting neuro-endocrine and prostate tumors. SPECT based dosimetry could be used for deriving dose values for individual voxels, as is the standard in external-beam radiation-therapy (EBRT). For this a time-activity-curve (TAC) at voxel resolution and also a voxel-wise modeling of radiation energy deposition are necessary. But a voxel-wise determination of TACs is problematic, since several confounding factors exist, such as e.g. poor count-statistics or registration inaccuracies, which add noise to the observed activity states. A particle filter (PF) is a class of methods which applies regularization based on a model of the temporal evolution of activity states. The aim of this study is to introduce the application of PFs for de-noising of per-voxel time-activity curves. Methods: We applied a PF for de-noising the TACs of 26 patients, who underwent 177Lu-DOTATOC or -PSMA therapy. The TACs were obtained from fully-quantitative, serial SPECT(/CT) data, acquired at 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h p.i. The model used in the PF was a mono-exponential decay and its free parameters were determined based on objective criteria. The time-integrated activities (TIA) resulting from the PF (PFF) were compared to the results of a mono-exponential fit (SF) of individual voxels in several volumes of interest (kidneys, spleen, tumors). Additionally, an organ-averaged TIA was derived from whole-organ VOIs and subsequent curve-fitting. This whole-organ TIA was also compared to the whole-organ TIAs obtained from summation of the voxel-wise TIAs from PFF and SF. Results: The number of particles was set to 1000. Optimal values for noise of observations and noise of the model were 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. The deviation of whole-organ TIAs from conventional organ-based dosimetry and the summation of the voxel-wise TIAs was substantial for SF (kidneys −22.3%, spleen −49.6%, tumor −60.0%), as well as for PFF (kidneys −37.1%, spleen −57.9%, tumor −70.9%). The distribution of voxel-wise half-lives resulting from the PFF method was considerably closer to the organ-averaged value, and the number of implausibly long half-lives (>physical HL) was reduced. Conclusion: The PFF leads to voxel-wise half-lives, which are more plausible than those resulting from SF. However, one has to admit that voxel-wise fitting generally leads to considerable deviations from the organ-averaged TIA as obtained by conventional whole-organ evaluation. Unfortunately, we did not have ground-truth TIA of our patient data and proper ground-truth could even be impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, there are strong indicators that particle filtering can be used for reducing voxel-wise TAC noise. © 2019",0,['Particle Filter'],The article focuses on particle filter de-noising for Lu-177 radionuclide therapy and does not discuss applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

So, it's talking about using a particle filter method for denoising data related to Lu-177 therapy. The background explains that this therapy uses SPECT-based dosimetry and deals with issues like poor count statistics or registration inaccuracies which add noise to the activity states. They applied a particle filter to de-noise TACs of 26 patients who underwent 177Lu-DOTATOC or -PSMA therapy. The methods involved using a mono-exponential decay model, and they compared their results with a standard fitting method. The conclusion suggests that particle filtering can reduce noise in voxel-wise TACs but acknowledges limitations without ground-truth data.

rayyan-1273747664,Spatial mapping of the biologic effectiveness of scanned particle beams: Towards biologically optimized particle therapy,"The physical properties of particles used in radiation therapy, such as protons, have been well characterized, and their dose distributions are superior to photon-based treatments. However, proton therapy may also have inherent biologic advantages that have not been capitalized on. Unlike photon beams, the linear energy transfer (LET) and hence biologic effectiveness of particle beams varies along the beam path. Selective placement of areas of high effectiveness could enhance tumor cell kill and simultaneously spare normal tissues. However, previous methods for mapping spatial variations in biologic effectiveness are time-consuming and often yield inconsistent results with large uncertainties. Thus the data needed to accurately model relative biological effectiveness to guide novel treatment planning approaches are limited. We used Monte Carlo modeling and high-content automated clonogenic survival assays to spatially map the biologic effectiveness of scanned proton beams with high accuracy and throughput while minimizing biological uncertainties. We found that the relationship between cell kill, dose, and LET, is complex and non-unique. Measured biologic effects were substantially greater than in most previous reports, and non-linear surviving fraction response was observed even for the highest LET values. Extension of this approach could generate data needed to optimize proton therapy plans incorporating variable RBE.",0,,The article focuses on proton therapy and does not discuss any AI methods or their application in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273747665,Automation and uncertainty analysis of a method for in-vivo range verification in particle therapy,"We introduce the automation of the range difference calculation deduced from particle-irradiation induced β+-activity distributions with the so-called most-likely-shift approach, and evaluate its reliability via the monitoring of algorithm- and patient-specific uncertainty factors. The calculation of the range deviation is based on the minimization of the absolute profile differences in the distal part of two activity depth profiles shifted against each other. Depending on the workflow of positron emission tomography (PET)-based range verification, the two profiles under evaluation can correspond to measured and simulated distributions, or only measured data from different treatment sessions. In comparison to previous work, the proposed approach includes an automated identification of the distal region of interest for each pair of PET depth profiles and under consideration of the planned dose distribution, resulting in the optimal shift distance. Moreover, it introduces an estimate of uncertainty associated to the identified shift, which is then used as weighting factor to 'red flag' problematic large range differences. Furthermore, additional patient-specific uncertainty factors are calculated using available computed tomography (CT) data to support the range analysis. The performance of the new method for in-vivo treatment verification in the clinical routine is investigated with in-room PET images for proton therapy as well as with offline PET images for proton and carbon ion therapy. The comparison between measured PET activity distributions and predictions obtained by Monte Carlo simulations or measurements from previous treatment fractions is performed. For this purpose, a total of 15 patient datasets were analyzed, which were acquired at Massachusetts General Hospital and Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center with in-room PET and offline PET/CT scanners, respectively. Calculated range differences between the compared activity distributions are reported in a 2D map in beam-eye-view. In comparison to previously proposed approaches, the new most-likely-shift method shows more robust results for assessing in-vivo the range from strongly varying PET distributions caused by differing patient geometry, ion beam species, beam delivery techniques, PET imaging concepts and counting statistics. The additional visualization of the uncertainties and the dedicated weighting strategy contribute to the understanding of the reliability of observed range differences and the complexity in the prediction of activity distributions. The proposed method promises to offer a feasible technique for clinical routine of PET-based range verification. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",0,,The article discusses automation and uncertainty analysis for range verification in particle therapy but does not explicitly explore AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273747666,The FLUKA code: An accurate simulation tool for particle therapy,"Monte Carlo (MC) codes are increasingly spreading in the hadrontherapy community due to their detailed description of radiation transport and interaction with matter. The suitability of a MC code for application to hadrontherapy demands accurate and reliable physical models capable of handling all components of the expected radiation field. This becomes extremely important for correctly performing not only physical but also biologically based dose calculations, especially in cases where ions heavier than protons are involved. In addition, accurate prediction of emerging secondary radiation is of utmost importance in innovative areas of research aiming at in vivo treatment verification. This contribution will address the recent developments of the FLUKA MC code and its practical applications in this field. Refinements of the FLUKA nuclear models in the therapeutic energy interval lead to an improved description of the mixed radiation field as shown in the presented benchmarks against experimental data with both 4He and 12C ion beams. Accurate description of ionization energy losses and of particle scattering and interactions lead to the excellent agreement of calculated depth-dose profiles with those measured at leading European hadron therapy centers, both with proton and ion beams. In order to support the application of FLUKA in hospital-based environments, Flair, the FLUKA graphical interface, has been enhanced with the capability of translating CT DICOM images into voxel-based computational phantoms in a fast and well-structured way.

rayyan-1273747668,On the probability of cure for heavy-ion radiotherapy,"The probability of a cure in radiation therapy (RT) - viewed as the probability of eventual extinction of all cancer cells - is unobservable, and the only way to compute it is through modeling the dynamics of cancer cell population during and post-treatment. The conundrum at the heart of biophysical models aimed at such prospective calculations is the absence of information on the initial size of the subpopulation of clonogenic cancer cells (also called stem-like cancer cells), that largely determines the outcome of RT, both in an individual and population settings. Other relevant parameters (e.g. potential doubling time, cell loss factor and survival probability as a function of dose) are, at least in principle, amenable to empirical determination. In this article we demonstrate that, for heavy-ion RT, microdosimetric considerations (justifiably ignored in conventional RT) combined with an expression for the clone extinction probability obtained from a mechanistic model of radiation cell survival lead to useful upper bounds on the size of the pre-treatment population of clonogenic cancer cells as well as upper and lower bounds on the cure probability. The main practical impact of these limiting values is the ability to make predictions about the probability of a cure for a given population of patients treated to newer, still unexplored treatment modalities from the empirically determined probability of a cure for the same or similar population resulting from conventional low linear energy transfer (typically photon/electron) RT. We also propose that the current trend to deliver a lower total dose in a smaller number of fractions with larger-than-conventional doses per fraction has physical limits that must be understood before embarking on a particular treatment schedule. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods applied to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

This has been accomplished for EBRT photon treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Extending the TCP model for low and high-risk patients would be beneficial in terms of overall decision making. Furthermore, different radiation treatment modalities such as protons and carbon-ions are becoming increasingly available. Consequently, there is a need for a complete TCP model. Methods: A TCP model was fitted and validated to a primary endpoint of 5-year biological no evidence of disease clinical outcome data obtained from a review of the literature for low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancer patients (5218 patients fitted, 1088 patients validated), treated by photons, protons, or carbon-ions. The review followed the preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement. Treatment regimens include standard fractionation and hypofractionation treatments. Residual analysis and goodness of fit statistics were applied. Results: The TCP model achieves a good level of fit overall, linear regression results in a p-value of <0.000 01 with an adjusted-weighted-R2 value of 0.77 and a weighted root mean squared error (wRMSE) of 1.2%, to the fitted clinical outcome data. Validation of the model utilizing three independent datasets obtained from the literature resulted in an adjusted-weighted-R2 value of 0.78 and a wRMSE of less than 1.8%, to the validation clinical outcome data. The weighted mean absolute residual across the entire dataset is found to be 5.4%.

A considerable uncertainty is associated with carcinogenesis from photon-based treatment, and even less established when including relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for particle therapy. The aim of this work was therefore to estimate and in particular explore relative risks (RR) of secondary cancer (SC) following particle therapy as applied in treatment of prostate cancer. Material and methods RRs of radiation-induced SC in the bladder and rectum were estimated using a bell-shaped dose–response model incorporating RBE and fractionation effects. The risks from volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were compared to intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and scanning carbon ions for ten patients. Results The mean estimated RR (95% CI) of SC for VMAT/C-ion was 1.31 (0.65–2.18) for the bladder and 0.58 (0.41–0.80) for the rectum. Corresponding values for VMAT/IMPT were 1.72 (1.06–2.37) and 1.10 (0.78–1.43). The radio-sensitivity parameter α had the strongest influence on the results with decreasing RR for increasing values of α.

Neoadjuvant treatment can reduce micrometastasis in lymph nodes to enable curative resection by down staging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the histological effect of neoadjuvant therapy on lymph node metastasis of ESCC by performing immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin staining. Methodology: A total of 3061 lymph nodes were examined from 62 patients who received neoadjuvant treatment followed by esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy. Results: We observed positive staining for cytokeratin in 276 (9.0%) lymph nodes, which included overt metastasis, micrometastasis and hyalinized cytokeratin particles (HCP). Patients with HCPs in lymph nodes had better outcomes than patients without HCPs in lymph node. A significant prognostic difference between the patients with HCPs and without HCPs was observed in a subgroup of patients with nodal metastasis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that HCP might reflect a degenerative change of cancer cells in lymph nodes and can predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy. © H.G.E.

The study focuses on histological markers rather than any technological or computational methods related to AI. So, based on this analysis, I should mark it as '0' because it doesn't meet the criteria of applying AI in carbon ion therapy."

Typically, the tumor is heated to hyperthermic temperatures (41-42 °C), which induced intravascular drug release from TSLs within the tumor tissue leading to high local drug concentrations (1-step delivery protocol). Next to providing a trigger for drug release, hyperthermia (HT) has been shown to be cytotoxic to tumor tissue, to enhance chemosensitivity and to increase particle extravasation from the vasculature into the tumor interstitial space. The latter can be exploited for a 2-step delivery protocol, where HT is applied prior to i.v. TSL injection to enhance tumor uptake, and after 4 hours waiting time for a second time to induce drug release. In this study, we compare the 1- and 2-step delivery protocols and investigate which factors are of importance for a therapeutic response. In murine B16 melanoma and BFS-1 sarcoma cell lines, HT induced an enhanced Dox uptake in 2D and 3D models, resulting in enhanced chemosensitivity. In vivo, therapeutic efficacy studies were performed for both tumor models, showing a therapeutic response for only the 1-step delivery protocol. SPECT/CT imaging allowed quantification of the liposomal accumulation in both tumor models at physiological temperatures and after a HT treatment. A simple two compartment model was used to derive respective rates for liposomal uptake, washout and retention, showing that the B16 model has a twofold higher liposomal uptake compared to the BFS-1 tumor. HT increases uptake and retention of liposomes in both tumors models by the same factor of 1.66 maintaining the absolute differences between the two models. Histology showed that HT induced apoptosis, blood vessel integrity and interstitial structures are important factors for TSL accumulation in the investigated tumor types. However, modeling data indicated that the intraliposomal Dox fraction did not reach therapeutic relevant concentrations in the tumor tissue in a 2-step delivery protocol due to the leaking of the drug from its liposomal carrier providing an explanation for the observed lack of efficacy. © Ivyspring International Publisher.",0,,The study focuses on thermosensitive liposomes and hyperthermia for drug delivery but does not involve any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

They compare different delivery protocols—1-step and 2-step—and look at factors like chemosensitivity, particle accumulation, and therapeutic efficacy in mouse models. They also use imaging techniques like SPECT/CT and develop a two-compartment model to analyze the rates of liposomal uptake and retention. Histology shows effects on apoptosis and blood vessel integrity. The conclusion is that the 1-step protocol was more effective because the drug didn't reach therapeutic concentrations in the 2-step method due to leakage. Now, where does AI come into play here? I don't see any mention of artificial intelligence methods or applications. The study uses models for data analysis but not AI techniques like machine learning, neural networks, etc. It's more about drug delivery mechanisms and thermal effects on tumors.

Materials and methods: Thirty-one patients with prostate cancer treated with CIRT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3-T was performed before and after CIRT. Before and after treatment, ADC values were measured in the tumors and in the benign tissues of the prostate, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were also assessed. We divided the patients into two groups: PSA response (PSA declines ≥50 %) and non-PSA response group (PSA declines <50 %). Results: After CIRT treatment, the mean ADC value of the tumors (1.23 × 10−3mm2/s) was significantly increased as compared with the pretreatment value (1.07 × 10−3mm2/s) (p < 0.001), whereas the ADC values of the benign tissues after treatment did not significantly increase compared with the pretreatment values (p = 0.235). The mean PSA level was significantly reduced from 2.027 ng/mL before treatment to 0.822 ng/mL, respectively, after treatment (p = 0.0063). The mean of ADC changes in PSA response group before and after CIRT was significantly higher than that in non-PSA response group (∆ADC value: 0.217 vs 0.097 × 10−3mm2/s, p = 0.0229), and the rate of patients with PSA response was higher in the high ∆ADC group (∆ADC ≥ 0.10) than in the low ∆ADC group (∆ADC < 0.10) (72.7 and 33.3 %, respectively), but marginally significant (p = 0.056). Additionally, the baseline tumor ADC values revealed a negative correlation with changes in PSA levels after treatment (correlation coefficient, ρ = −0.524; p = 0.0025).

Combined radiochemotherapy protocols using gemcitabine and hypofractionated X-rays are ongoing in several clinical trials. Recent results indicate that charged particle therapy substantially increases local control of resectable and unresectable pancreas cancer, as predicted from previous radiobiology studies considering the high tumour hypoxia. Combination with chemotherapy improves the overall survival. We compared published data on X-ray and charged particle clinical results with or without adjuvant chemotherapy calculating the biological effective dose. We show that chemoradiotherapy with protons or carbon ions results in 1-year overall survival significantly higher than those obtained with other treatment schedules. Further hypofractionation using charged particles may result in improved local control and survival.

rayyan-1273747676,Assessment and improvements of Geant4 hadronic models in the context of prompt-gamma hadrontherapy monitoring,"Monte Carlo simulations are nowadays essential tools for a wide range of research topics in the field of radiotherapy. They also play an important role in the effort to develop a real-time monitoring system for quality assurance in proton and carbon ion therapy, by means of prompt-gamma detection. The internal theoretical nuclear models of Monte Carlo simulation toolkits are of decisive importance for the accurate description of neutral or charged particle emission, produced by nuclear interactions between beam particles and target nuclei. We assess the performance of Geant4 nuclear models in the context of prompt-gamma emission, comparing them with experimental data from proton and carbon ion beams. As has been shown in the past and further indicated in our study, the prompt-gamma yields are consistently overestimated by Geant4 by a factor of about 100% to 200% over an energy range from 80 to 310 MeV/u for the case of 12C, and to a lesser extent for 160 MeV protons. Furthermore, we focus on the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) modeling of ion-ion collisions, in order to optimize its description of light nuclei, which are abundant in the human body and mainly anticipated in hadrontherapy applications. The optimization has been performed by benchmarking QMD free parameters with well established nuclear properties. In addition, we study the effect of this optimization on charged particle emission. With the usage of the proposed parameter values, discrepancies reduce to less than 70%, with the highest values being attributed to the nucleon-ion induced prompt-gammas. This conclusion, also confirmed by the disagreement we observe in the case of proton beams, indicates the need for further investigation on nuclear models which describe proton and neutron induced nuclear reactions. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",0,,The article discusses improvements in Monte Carlo simulation models for prompt-gamma detection in hadrontherapy but does not explore any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273747677,Assessment of potential advantages of relevant ions for particle therapy: A model based study,"Purpose: Different ion types offer different physical and biological advantages for therapeutic applications. The purpose of this work is to assess the advantages of the most commonly used ions in particle therapy, i.e., carbon (12C), helium (4He), and protons (1H) for different treatment scenarios. Methods: A treatment planning analysis based on idealized target geometries was performed using the treatment planning software TRiP98. For the prediction of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) that is required for biological optimization in treatment planning the local effect model (LEM IV) was used. To compare the three ion types, the peak-to-entrance ratio (PER) was determined for the physical dose (PERPHYS), the RBE (PERRBE), and the RBE-weighted dose (PERBIO) resulting for different dose-levels, field configurations, and tissue types. Further, the dose contribution to artificial organs at risk (OAR) was assessed and a comparison of the dose distribution for the different ion types was performed for a patient with chordoma of the skull base. Results: The study showed that the advantages of the ions depend on the physical and biological properties and the interplay of both. In the case of protons, the consideration of a variable RBE instead of the clinically applied generic RBE of 1.1 indicates an advantage in terms of an increased PERRBE for the analyzed configurations. Due to the fact that protons show a somewhat better PERPHYS compared to helium and carbon ions whereas helium shows a higher PERRBE compared to protons, both protons and helium ions show a similar RBE-weighted dose distribution. Carbon ions show the largest variation of the PERRBE with tissue type and a benefit for radioresistant tumor types due to their higher LET. Furthermore, in the case of a two-field irradiation, an additional gain in terms of PERBIO is observed when using an orthogonal field configuration for carbon ions as compared to opposing fields. In contrast, for protons, the PERBIO is almost independent on the field configuration. Concerning the artificial lateral OAR, the volume receiving 20% of the prescribed RBE-weighted dose (V20) was reduced by over 35% using helium ions and by over 40% using carbon ions compared to protons. The analysis of the patient plan showed that protons, helium, and carbon ions are similar in terms of target coverage whereas the dose to the surrounding tissue is increasing from carbon ions toward protons. The mean dose to the brain stem can be reduced by more than 55% when using helium ions and by further 25% when using carbon ions instead of protons. Conclusions: The comparison of the PERRBE and PERPHYS of the three ion types suggests a strong dependence of the advantages of the three ions on the dose-level, tissue type, and field configuration. In terms of conformity, i.e., dose to the normal tissue, a clear gain is expected using carbon or helium ions compared to protons. ©2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",0,[],The article does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

The methods involved calculating various ratios like PERPHYS, PERRBE, and PERBIO for different scenarios. They also looked at dose contributions to organs at risk and compared these across the ions in both idealized cases and a real patient scenario with chordoma of the skull base. The conclusion was that carbon and helium ions have advantages over protons in terms of reducing dose to surrounding tissues and specific organs at risk, especially when considering different field configurations and tissue types."

FLUKA, a Monte Carlo package well-established in particle therapy applications, was extended to simulate raster-scanning delivery with clinical data, unavailable as built-in feature. A new complex beam source, compatible with FLUKA public programming interface, was implemented in Fortran to model the specific properties of raster-scanning, i.e. delivery by means of multiple spot sources with variable spatial distributions, energies and numbers of particles. The source was plugged into the MC engine through the user hook system provided by FLUKA. Additionally, routines were provided to populate the beam source with treatment plan data, stored as DICOM RTPlan or TRiP98's RST format, enabling MC recomputation of clinical plans. Finally, facilities were integrated to read computerised tomography (CT) data into FLUKA. The tool was used to recompute two representative carbon ion treatment plans, a skull base and a prostate case, prepared with analytical dose calculation (TRiP98). Selected, clinically relevant issues influencing the dose distributions were investigated: (1) presence of positioning errors, (2) influence of fiducial markers and (3) variations in pencil beam width. Notable differences in modelling of these challenging situations were observed between the analytical and Monte Carlo results. In conclusion, a tool was developed, to support particle therapy research and treatment, when high precision MC calculations are required, e.g. in presence of severe density heterogeneities or in quality assurance procedures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",0,,The article focuses on Monte Carlo simulations for dose computation in particle therapy but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Methods and Materials Eighty irradiation fields for delivery of C-ion RT were analyzed in 20 patients with stage I NSCLC. Computed tomography images were obtained twice before treatment initiation. Simulated dose distribution was reconstructed on computed tomography for confirmation under the same settings as actual treatment with respiratory gating and bony structure matching. Dose-volume histogram parameters, such as %D95 (percentage of D95 relative to the prescribed dose), were calculated. Patients with any field for which the %D95 of gross tumor volume (GTV) was below 90% were classified as unacceptable for treatment, and the optimal target margin for such cases was examined. Results Five patients with a total of 8 fields (10% of total number of fields analyzed) were classified as unacceptable according to %D95 of GTV, although most patients showed no remarkable change in the dose-volume histogram parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that tumor displacement and change in water-equivalent pathlength were significant predictive factors of unacceptable cases (P<.001 and P=.002, respectively). The main cause of degradation of the dose distribution was tumor displacement in 7 of the 8 unacceptable fields. A 6-mm planning target volume margin ensured a GTV %D95 of >90%, except in 1 extremely unacceptable field. Conclusions According to this simulation analysis of C-ion RT for stage I NSCLC, a few fields were reported as unacceptable and required resetting of body position and reconfirmation. In addition, tumor displacement and change in water-equivalent pathlength (bone shift and/or chest wall thickness) were identified as factors influencing the robustness of dose distribution.

Methods: The relative electron density ∂e and effective atomic number Zeff are calculated for 71 tabulated tissue compositions. For MC simulations, the mass density is derived via one linear fit in the ∂e that covers the entire range of tissue compositions (except lung tissue). Elemental mass fractions are predicted from the ∂e and the Zeff in combination. Since particle therapy dose planning and verification is especially sensitive to accurate material assignment, differences to the ground truth are further analyzed for mass density, I-value predictions, and stopping power ratios (SPR) for ions. Dose studies with monoenergetic proton and carbon ions in 12 tissues which showed the largest differences of single energy CT (SECT) to DECT are presented with respect to range uncertainties. The standard approach (SECT) and the new DECT approach are compared to reference Bragg peak positions. Results: Mean deviations to ground truth in mass density predictions could be reduced for soft tissue from (0.5±0.6)% (SECT) to (0.2±0.2)% with the DECT method. Maximum SPR deviations could be reduced significantly for soft tissue from 3.1% (SECT) to 0.7% (DECT) and for bone tissue from 0.8% to 0.1%. MeanI-value deviations could be reduced for soft tissue from (1.1±1.4%, SECT) to (0.4±0.3%) with the presented method. Predictions of elemental composition were improved for every element. Mean and maximum deviations from ground truth of all elemental mass fractions could be reduced by at least a half with DECT compared to SECT (except soft tissue hydrogen and nitrogen where the reduction was slightly smaller). The carbon and oxygen mass fraction predictions profit especially from the DECT information. Dose studies showed that most of the 12 selected tissues would profit significantly (up to 2.2%) from DECT material decomposition with no noise present. The ∂e associated with an absolute noise of ±0.01 and Zeff associated with an absolute noise of ±0.2 resulted in ±10% standard variation in the carbon and oxygen mass fraction prediction. Conclusions: Accurate stopping power prediction is mainly determined by the correct mass density prediction. Theoretical improvements in range predictions with DECT data in the order of 0.1%-2.1% were observed. Further work is needed to quantify the potential improvements from DECT compared to SECT in measured image data associated with artifacts and noise. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",0,,The article discusses tissue decomposition using dual energy CT for dose calculation but does not employ any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Even with a full-ring geometry, the OpenPET has an open gap between its 2 detector rings through which the treatment beam passes. Following our initial 2008 proposal, we developed a small prototype in 2010 to show a proof-of-concept. Now, we report the development of a prototype whole-body OpenPET. The key technology which enabled the OpenPET realization is our original, 4-layered depth-of-interaction detector. In order to measure a radiation from the limited activity produced though fragmentation reactions, Zr-doped GSO (GSOZ), which contains less natural radioactivity, was chosen for the scintillators instead of Lu-based scintillators although timing performance was compromised. In order to compensate for the limited light yield, on the other hand, we used 64-channel flat-panel PMTs with a super-bialkali photocathode, which had a 30% higher quantum efficiency. In order to enable stable in-beam PET measurement even under high background radiations, voltage divider circuits were designed to provide 5 times higher linearity. Additionally, to avoid severe radiation damage, we did not use gain control ASICs in the front-end circuits, and position analyzer circuits were placed with a 15-m cable extension. The prototype consists of 2 detector rings, and each detector ring has 2 sub-rings of 40 detectors. Each detector consists of 16 × 16 × 4 array of GSOZ (2.8 × 2.8 × 7.5mm3). The portable gantry has a compact design; each detector ring has a 940 mm outer diameter and 171 mm thickness for the detector inner bore of 640 mm diameter and 113 mm thickness.

The shortage of precise measurements, especially of double differential cross sections, has triggered many dedicated experiments at relativistic energies. Aiming to explore the Fermi energy regime, as well, where different reaction mechanisms are involved, we measured the 12C fragmentation at 62 AMeV on a 12C and a 197Au target.

In theory, αRPT can be personalized through pre-therapeutic imaging and dosimetry. However, in practice, given the particularities of α-particle emissions, a dosimetric methodology that accurately predicts the thresholds for organ toxicity has not been reported. This is in part due to the fact that the biological effects caused by α-particle radiation differ markedly from the effects caused by traditional external beam (photon or electron) radiation or β-particle emitting radiopharmaceuticals. The concept of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is used to quantify the ratio of absorbed doses required to achieve a given biological response with alpha particles versus a reference radiation (typically a beta emitter or external beam radiation). However, as conventionally defined, the RBE varies as a function of absorbed dose and therefore a single RBE value is limited in its utility because it cannot be used to predict response over a wide range of absorbed doses. Therefore, efforts are underway to standardize bioeffect modeling for different fractionation schemes and dose rates for both nuclear medicine and external beam radiotherapy. Given the preponderant use of external beams of radiation compared to nuclear medicine in cancer therapy, the more clinically relevant quantity, the 2 Gy equieffective dose, EQD2(α/β), has recently been proposed by the ICRU. In concert with EQD2(α/β), we introduce a new, redefined RBE quantity, named RBE2(α/β), as the ratio of the two linear coefficients that characterize the α particle absorbed dose-response curve and the low-LET megavoltage photon 2 Gy fraction equieffective dose-response curve. The theoretical framework for the proposed new formalism is presented along with its application to experimental data obtained from irradiation of a breast cancer cell line. Radiobiological parameters are obtained using the linear quadratic model to fit cell survival data for MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells that were irradiated with either α particles or a single fraction of low-LET 137Cs γ rays. From these, the linear coefficient for both the biologically effective dose (BED) and the EQD2(α/β) response lines were derived for fractionated irradiation. The standard RBE calculation, using the traditional single fraction reference radiation, gave RBE values that ranged from 2.4 for a surviving fraction of 0.82-6.0 for a surviving fraction of 0.02, while the dose-independent RBE2(4.6) value was 4.5 for all surviving fraction values. Furthermore, bioeffect modeling with RBE2(α/β) and EQD2(α/β) demonstrated the capacity to predict the surviving fraction of cells irradiated with acute and fractionated low-LET radiation, α particles and chronic exponentially decreasing dose rates of low-LET radiation. RBE2(α/β) is independent of absorbed dose for α-particle emitters and it provides a more logical framework for data reporting and conversion to equieffective dose than the conventional dose-dependent definition of RBE. Moreover, it provides a much needed foundation for the ongoing development of an α-particle dosimetry paradigm and will facilitate the use of tolerance dose data available from external beam radiation therapy, thereby helping to develop αRPT as a single modality as well as for combination therapies. © 2014 by Radiation Research Society.",0,[],The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273747684,Relative clinical effectiveness of carbon ion radiotherapy: Theoretical modelling for H&N tumours,"Comparison of the efficiency of photon and carbon ion radiotherapy (RT) administered with the same number of fractions might be of limited clinical interest, since a wide range of fractionation patterns are used clinically today. Due to advanced photon treatment techniques, hypofractionation is becoming increasingly accepted for prostate and lung tumours, whereas patients with head and neck tumours still benefit from hyperfractionated treatments. In general, the number of fractions is considerably lower in carbon ion RT. A clinically relevant comparison would be between fractionation schedules that are optimal within each treatment modality category. In this in silico study, the relative clinical effectiveness (RCE) of carbon ions was investigated for human salivary gland tumours, assuming various radiation sensitivities related to their oxygenation. The results indicate that, for hypoxic tumours in the absence of reoxygenation, the RCE (defined as the ratio of D50 for photons to carbon ions) ranges from 3.5 to 5.7, corresponding to carbon ion treatments given in 36 and 3 fractions, respectively, and 30 fractions for photons. Assuming that interfraction local oxygenation changes take place, results for RCE are lower than that for an oxic tumour if only a few fractions of carbon ions are used. If the carbon ion treatment is given in more than 12 fractions, the RCE is larger for the hypoxic than for the well-oxygenated tumour. In conclusion, this study showed that in silico modelling enables the study of a wide range of factors in the clinical considerations and could be an important step towards individualisation of RT treatments. © The Author 2015.",0,,The article does not explicitly explore any AI methods but focuses on theoretical modeling and clinical effectiveness comparisons between photon and carbon ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on its abstract.

rayyan-1273747685,Temporal lobe reactions after carbon ion radiation therapy: Comparison of relative biological effectiveness-weighted tolerance doses predicted by local effect models i and IV,"Purpose To compare the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted tolerance doses for temporal lobe reactions after carbon ion radiation therapy using 2 different versions of the local effect model (LEM I vs LEM IV) for the same patient collective under identical conditions. Methods and Materials In a previous study, 59 patients were investigated, of whom 10 experienced temporal lobe reactions (TLR) after carbon ion radiation therapy for low-grade skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma at Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany in 2002 and 2003. TLR were detected as visible contrast enhancements on T1-weighted MRI images within a median follow-up time of 2.5 years. Although the derived RBE-weighted temporal lobe doses were based on the clinically applied LEM I, we have now recalculated the RBE-weighted dose distributions using LEM IV and derived dose-response curves with Dmax,V-1 cmÂ(the RBE-weighted maximum dose in the remaining temporal lobe volume, excluding the volume of 1 cmÂwith the highest dose) as an independent dosimetric variable. The resulting RBE-weighted tolerance doses were compared with those of the previous study to assess the clinical impact of LEM IV relative to LEM I. Results The dose-response curve of LEM IV is shifted toward higher values compared to that of LEM I. The RBE-weighted tolerance dose for a 5% complication probability (TD5) increases from 68.8 ± 3.3 to 78.3 ± 4.3 Gy (RBE) for LEM IV as compared to LEM I. Conclusions LEM IV predicts a clinically significant increase of the RBE-weighted tolerance doses for the temporal lobe as compared to the currently applied LEM I. The limited available photon data do not allow a final conclusion as to whether RBE predictions of LEM I or LEM IV better fit better clinical experience in photon therapy. The decision about a future clinical application of LEM IV therefore requires additional analysis of temporal lobe reactions in a comparable photon-treated collective using the same dosimetric variable as in the present study. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

rayyan-1273747687,Monte Carlo calculations of secondary neutron doses in adult male patients during carbon ion radiotherapy,"Patients undergoing carbon ion radiotherapy are exposed to secondary neutrons that cause harmful biological effects such as the development of secondary cancer. Previous studies about the secondary neutrons and fragments produced by carbon ion interacting with matters failed to evaluate organ doses absorbed by patients due to these secondary neutrons. In this paper, we report a study to estimate the organ equivalent doses by these secondary neutrons using Monte Carlo calculations and anatomically realistic voxel phantoms. The MCNPX code is used to simulated the transport of 230MeV/u carbon ion getting through the Ridge Filter (RF) and Multi-Leaf Collimator(MLC), and then entering into the patient model, i.e. the RPI Adult Male phantom in this simulation. The similar modeling without the degradation and control of RF and MLC is also conducted to compare the effect on the production of secondary neutrons. As a result, the specific energy spectra of secondary neutrons and their equivalent doses in different organs are obtained. It is found that more secondary neutrons would be produced when treating with using the RF and MLC, especially for neutrons with energy lower than 200 MeV. In addition, a comparison about the equivalent dose between the vertical and lateral incidence is conducted to further understand the influence of RF and MLC. Patients would suffer a higher dose due to neutrons when the treatment is from vertical incidence, especially for organs distal from the target. Because of the external neutrons, the doses would be higher when adding the RF and MLC into the treatment. © Copyright (2015) by the American Nuclear Society.",0,,The study focuses on Monte Carlo simulations for neutron dose estimation but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Methods Thirty-nine patients receiving C-ion RT for head and neck cancer were evaluated for ARM (once per week for 6 weeks) according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring systems. The irradiation schedule typically used was 64 Gy [relative biological effectiveness (RBE)] in 16 fractions for 4 weeks. Maximum point doses in the palate and tongue were compared with ARM in each patient. Results The location of the ARM coincided with the high-dose area in the OMDS-model. There was a clear dose-response relationship between maximum point dose and ARM grade assessed using the RTOG criteria but not the CTCAE. The threshold doses for grade 2-3 ARM in the palate and tongue were 43.0 Gy(RBE) and 54.3 Gy(RBE), respectively. Conclusions The OMDS-model was useful for predicting the location and severity of ARM.

rayyan-1273747689,Can particle beam therapy be improved using helium ions? – A planning study focusing on pediatric patients,"Aim To explore the potential of scanned helium ion beam therapy (4He) compared to proton therapy in a comparative planning study focusing on pediatric patients. This was motivated by the superior biological and physical characteristics of 4He. Material and methods For eleven neuroblastoma (NB), nine Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), five Wilms tumor (WT), five ependymoma (EP) and four Ewing sarcoma (EW) patients, treatment plans were created for protons and 4He. Dose prescription to the planning target volume (PTV) was 21 Gy [relative biological effectiveness (RBE)] (NB), 19.8 Gy (RBE) (HL), 25.2 Gy (RBE) for the WT boost volume and 54 Gy (RBE) for EP and EW patients. A pencil beam algorithm for protons (constant RBE = 1.1) and 4He was implemented in the treatment planning system Hyperion. For 4He the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was calculated with a ‘zonal’ model based on different linear energy transfer regions. Results Target constraints were fulfilled for all indications. For NB patients differences for kidneys and liver were observed for all dose-volume areas, except the high-dose volume. The body volume receiving up to 12.6 Gy (RBE) was reduced by up to 10% with 4He. For WT patients the mean and high-dose volume for the liver was improved when using 4He. For EP normal tissue dose was reduced using 4He with 12.7% of the voxels receiving higher doses using protons. For HL and EW sarcoma patients the combination of large PTV volumes with the position of the organs at risk (OARs) obliterated the differences between the two particle species, while patients with the heart close to the PTV could benefit from 4He. Conclusion Treatment plan quality improved with 4He compared to proton plans, but advantages in OAR sparing were depending on indication and tumor geometries.

rayyan-1273747690,A trichrome beam model for biological dose calculation in scanned carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning,"In scanned carbon-ion (C-ion) radiotherapy, some primary C-ions undergo nuclear reactions before reaching the target and the resulting particles deliver doses to regions at a significant distance from the central axis of the beam. The effects of these particles on physical dose distribution are accounted for in treatment planning by representing the transverse profile of the scanned C-ion beam as the superposition of three Gaussian distributions. In the calculation of biological dose distribution, however, the radiation quality of the scanned C-ion beam has been assumed to be uniform over its cross-section, taking the average value over the plane at a given depth (monochrome model). Since these particles, which have relatively low radiation quality, spread widely compared to the primary C-ions, the radiation quality of the beam should vary with radial distance from the central beam axis. To represent its transverse distribution, we propose a trichrome beam model in which primary C-ions, heavy fragments with atomic number Z ≥ 3, and light fragments with Z ≤ 2 are assigned to the first, second, and third Gaussian components, respectively. Assuming a realistic beam-delivery system, we performed computer simulations using Geant4 Monte Carlo code for analytical beam modeling of the monochrome and trichrome models. The analytical beam models were integrated into a treatment planning system for scanned C-ion radiotherapy. A target volume of 20 x 20 x 40 mm3 was defined within a water phantom. A uniform biological dose of 2.65 Gy (RBE) was planned for the target with the two beam models based on the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM). The plans were recalculated with Geant4, and the recalculated biological dose distributions were compared with the planned distributions. The mean target dose of the recalculated distribution with the monochrome model was 2.72 Gy (RBE), while the dose with the trichrome model was 2.64 Gy (RBE). The monochrome model underestimated the RBE within the target due to the assumption of no radial variations in radiation quality. Conversely, the trichrome model accurately predicted the RBE even in a small target. Our results verify the applicability of the trichrome model for clinical use in C-ion radiotherapy treatment planning. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",0,,The article discusses beam modeling and dose calculation techniques but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

This is the first report on biophysical evaluation of Monte Carlo simulated predictive models of prescribed dose for four particle qualities i.e., proton, helium-, carbon- or oxygen ions using raster-scanning technology and clinical therapy settings at HIT. A high level of agreement was found between the in silico simulations, the physical dosimetry and the clonogenic tumor cell survival. The cell fluorescence ion track hybrid detector (Cell-Fit-HD) technology was employed to detect particle traverse per cell nucleus. Across a panel of radiobiological surrogates studied such as late ROS accumulation and apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activation), the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) chiefly correlated with the radiation species-specific spatio-temporal pattern of DNA double strand break (DSB) formation and repair kinetic. The size and the number of residual nuclear γ-H2AX foci increased as a function of linear energy transfer (LET) and RBE, reminiscent of enhanced DNA-damage complexity and accumulation of non-repairable DSB.

rayyan-1273747692,Range verification methods in particle therapy: Underlying physics and Monte Carlo modelling,"Hadron therapy allows for highly conformal dose distributions and better sparing of organs-at-risk, thanks to the characteristic dose deposition as function of depth. However, the quality of hadron therapy treatments is closely connected with the ability to predict and achieve a given beam range in the patient. Currently, uncertainties in particle range lead to the employment of safety margins, at the expense of treatment quality. Much research in particle therapy is therefore aimed at developing methods to verify the particle range in patients. Non-invasive in-vivo monitoring of the particle range can be performed by detecting secondary radiation, emitted from the patient as a result of nuclear interactions of charged hadrons with tissue, including β+ emitters, prompt photons, and charged fragments. The correctness of the dose delivery can be verified by comparing measured and pre-calculated distributions of the secondary particles. The reliability of Monte Carlo (MC) predictions is a key issue. Correctly modelling the production of secondaries is a non-trivial task, because it involves nuclear physics interactions at energies, where no rigorous theories exist to describe them. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of various aspects in modelling the physics processes for range verification with secondary particles produced in proton, carbon, and heavier ion irradiation. We discuss electromagnetic and nuclear interactions of charged hadrons in matter, which is followed by a summary of some widely used MC codes in hadron therapy.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between BR and overall mortality (OAM) in high-risk prostate cancer patients who were treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and had long-term follow-up in 2 prospective trials. METHODS: In the 2 phase 2 clinical trials, which involved 466 prostate cancer patients who received 63.0 to 66.0 Gy of CIRT (relative biological effect) in 20 fractions between 2000 and 2007, 324 patients who were deemed to be at high risk on the basis of the modified D'Amico classification criteria and received CIRT along with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were examined. The OAM rate was adjusted for the ADT duration, and multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model were performed for OAM with BR as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 107.4 months, and the 5- and 10-year OAM rates after adjustments for the ADT duration were 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0%-9.4%) and 23.9% (95% CI, 16.4%-26.2%), respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of BR (hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% Cl, 1.57-5.08; P =.001) was one of the predictive factors for OAM. On the other hand, the duration of ADT had no impact on OAM. CONCLUSIONS: BR after CIRT combined with ADT is an independent predictive factor for OAM in high-risk prostate cancer patients. The results of this study could be applied to other high-dose radiation therapies. Cancer 2016;122:3225–31. © 2016 The Authors.

rayyan-1273747696,An analytical solution to lateral dose prediction in Hadrontherapy,"A flexible model for the calculation of the lateral deflection of a proton pencil beam in hadrontherapy is presented. The model is based on the full Molière theory for Coulomb multiple scattering, that is reliable for any depth and for every kind of media and mixture, since energy loss effects by primary process are fully taken into account. The use of the original equations of the theory, without any free parameter, allows the exact description of the electromagnetic interaction with a full accuracy and a fast computing time. The contribution of the nuclear interactions are also fully taken into account with a fit, with only two free parameters, on the prediction of the FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) code.

rayyan-1273747697,Reducing the uncertainties in particle therapy,"The use of fundamental Nuclear Physics in Nuclear Medicine has a significant impact in the fight against cancer. Hadrontherapy is an innovative cancer radiotherapy method using nuclear particles (protons, neutrons and ions) for the treatment of early and advanced tumors. The main goal of proton therapy is to deliver high radiation doses to the tumor volume with minimal damage to healthy tissues and organs. The purpose of this work was to investigate the dosimetric errors in clinical proton therapy dose calculation due to the presence of metallic implants in the treatment plan, and to determine the impact of the errors. The results indicate that the errors introduced by the treatment planning systems are higher than 10% in the prediction of the dose at isocenter when the proton beam is passing directly through a metallic titanium alloy implant. In conclusion, we recommend that pencil-beam algorithms not be used when planning treatment for patients with titanium alloy implants, and to consider implementing methods to mitigate the effects of the implants. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",0,,"The abstract does not mention any AI methods and focuses on dosimetric errors in proton therapy due to metallic implants, unrelated to AI applications in carbon ion therapy.","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273747698,Endosomal trafficking of nanoformulated antiretroviral therapy facilitates drug particle carriage and HIV clearance,"Limitations of antiretroviral therapy (ART) include poor patient adherence, drug toxicities, viral resistance, and failure to penetrate viral reservoirs. Recent developments in nanoformulated ART (nanoART) could overcome such limitations. To this end, we now report a novel effect of nanoART that facilitates drug depots within intracellular compartments at or adjacent to the sites of the viral replication cycle. Poloxamer 407-coated nanocrystals containing the protease inhibitor atazanavir (ATV) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization. These drug particles readily accumulated in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). NanoATV concentrations were~1,000 times higher in cells than those that could be achieved by the native drug. ATV particles in late and recycling endosome compartments were seen following pulldown by immunoaffinity chromatography with Rab-specific antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads. Confocal microscopy provided cross validation by immunofluorescent staining of the compartments. Mathematical modeling validated drug-endosomal interactions. Measures of reverse transcriptase activity and HIV-1 p24 levels in culture media and cells showed that such endosomal drug concentrations enhanced antiviral responses up to 1,000-fold. We conclude that late and recycling endosomes can serve as depots for nanoATV. The colocalization of nano- ATV at endosomal sites of viral assembly and its slow release sped antiretroviral activities. Long-acting nanoART can serve as a drug carrier in both cells and subcellular compartments and, as such, can facilitate viral clearance. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Materials and methods: A cohort of 154 prostate adenocarcinoma patients were retrospectively analyzed. The AUT levels were graded according to CTCAE 4.03. Based on dosimetric parameters and/or clinical factors, a set of variables with best-fit values determined in the two models was validated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and used to correlate the predicted and observed NTCP rates for both levels and related endpoints.        Result: 59 (38.3%) patients experienced AUT. For LKB model, the equivalent uniform doses (EUDs) were calculated to be 62.0 GyE (following V-61.5 > 1.7%) and 61.2 GyE (following maximum dose > 63.0 GyE) with predicted NTCP rates of 37.0% (AUC: 0.71) and 15.6% (AUC: 0.65) for AUT G1&2 and G2 of bladder. While for the multivariate model, the predicted NTCP rates was 37.1% (AUC: 0.70) and 20.2% (AUC: 0.64) for AUT G1&2 and G2, associated with V-61 and V-65, respectively. Nocturia was associated with bladder volume and maximum dose for G1&2, with patient's age and maximum bladder dose for G2. Other predictable endpoints were associated with V->= 61. The predicted NTCPs agree with the observed complication rates for bladder and its wall.        Conclusions: The LKB model successfully predicted the NTCP rates of both AUT levels and urgency urination. The multivariate model predicted well on both levels and nocturia.

rayyan-1273750768,The sensitivity of radiobiological models in carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and its consequences on the clinical treatment plan: Differences between LEM and MKM models,"PurposeCarbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) relies on relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose calculations. Japanese clinics predominantly use the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM), while European centers utilize the local effect model (LEM). Despite both models estimating RBE-distributions in tissue, their physical and mathematical assumptions differ, leading to significant disparities in RBE-weighted doses. Several European clinics adopted Japanese treatment schedules, necessitating adjustments in dose prescriptions and organ at risk (OAR) constraints. In the context of these two clinically used standards for RBE-weighted dose estimation, the objective of this study was to highlight specific scenarios for which the translations between models diverge, as shortcomings between them can influence clinical decisions.MethodsOur aim was to discuss planning strategies minimizing those discrepancies, ultimately striving for more accurate and robust treatments. Evaluations were conducted in a virtual water phantom and patient CT-geometry, optimizing LEM RBE-weighted dose first and recomputing MKM thereafter. Dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) distributions were also assessed.ResultsResults demonstrate how various parameters influence LEM/MKM translation. Similar LEM-dose distributions lead to markedly different MKM-dose distributions and variations in LETd. Generally, a homogeneous LEM RBE-weighted dose aligns with lower MKM values in most of the target volume. Nevertheless, paradoxical MKM hotspots may emerge (at the end of the range), potentially influencing clinical outcomes. Therefore, translation between models requires great caution.ConclusionsUnderstanding the relationship between these two clinical standards enables combining European and Japanese based experiences. The implementation of optimal planning strategies ensures the safety and acceptability of the clinical plan for both models and therefore enhances plan robustness from the RBE-weighted dose and LETd distribution point of view. This study emphasizes the importance of optimal planning strategies and the need for comprehensive CIRT plan quality assessment tools. In situations where simultaneous LEM and MKM computation capabilities are lacking, it can provide guidance in plan design, ultimately contributing to enhanced CIRT outcomes.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications in carbon ion therapy.

rayyan-1273750776,Geant4 electromagnetic physics model assessment for RBE-weighted dose calculation of carbon-ion radiotherapy,"Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is being increasingly practiced owing to its advantages over conventional photon-based radiotherapy. Several CIRT-related dose calculation studies considering the biological effects of carbon ions were performed using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit. For accurate RBE-weighted dose calculation in CIRT, the Geant4 physics models used in a simulation code need to be validated. Previous studies have validated the hadronic physics model of Geant4, but a validation study for electromagnetic (EM) physics models is missing. Therefore, we validated the Geant4 EM physics models for carbon RBE-weighted dose calculation. For the validation process in Geant4, the geometry used in the Microdosimetric kinetic model was irradiated by mono-energy beams between 0.1 and 1000 MeV/u of six elements (H, He, Li, Be, B, and C). The imparted dose calculated using various EM physics models is compared with the theoretical value. A G4EMStandardPhysics-based model is confirmed to result in breaking points for RBE-weighted dose calculations, whereas no such breaking points are observed when using our physics model and Geant4-DNA physics model. Because the breaking points observed in the results may induce uncorrected dose calculations, validating the EM physics models is recommended when performing carbon RBE-weighted dose calculation using Geant4.",0,,The article focuses on validating electromagnetic physics models for dose calculation but does not explore or apply AI methods in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750777,Sensitivity study of the microdosimetric kinetic model parameters for carbon ion radiotherapy,"In carbon ion therapy treatment planning, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is accounted for by optimization of the RBE-weighted dose (biological dose). The RBE calculation methods currently applied clinically in carbon ion therapy are derived from the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) in Japan and the local effect model (LEM) in Europe. The input parameters of these models are based on fit to experimental data subjected to uncertainties. We therefore performed a sensitivity study of the MKM input parameters, i.e. the domain radius (r(d)), the nucleus radius (R-n) and the parameters of the linear quadratic (LQ) model (alpha(x) and beta). The study was performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code, using spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) scenarios in water and a biological dose distribution in a clinical patient case. Comparisons were done between biological doses estimated applying the MKM with parameters based on HSG cells, and with HSG parameters varied separately by +/- {5, 25, 50}%. Comparisons were also done between parameter sets from different cell lines (HSG, V79, CHO and T1), as well as versions of the LEM. Of the parameters, r(d) had the largest impact on the biological dose distribution, especially on the absolute dose values. Increasing this parameter by 25% decreased the biological dose level at the center of a 3 Gy(RBE) SOBP by 14%. Variations in R-n only influenced the biological dose distribution towards the particle range, and variations in alpha(x) resulted in minor changes in the biological dose, with an increasing impact towards the particle range. beta had the overall smallest influence on the SOBPs, but the impact could become more pronounced if alternative (LET dependent) implementations are used. The resulting percentage change in the SOBPs was generally less than the percentage change in the parameters. The patient case showed similar effects as with the SOBPs in water, and parameter variations had similar impact on the biological dose when using the clinical MKM and the general MKM. The clinical LEM calculated the highest biological doses to both tumor and surrounding healthy tissues, with a median target dose (D-50(%)) of 40.5 Gy(RBE), while the MKM with HSG and V79 parameters resulted in a D-50% of 34.2 and 36.9 Gy(RBE), respectively. In all, the observed change in biological dose distribution due to parameter variations demonstrates the importance of accurate input parameters when applying the MKM in treatment planning.",0,,The study focuses on sensitivity analysis of model parameters in carbon ion therapy treatment planning but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The study looks at how sensitive these models are to changes in their input parameters like domain radius, nucleus radius, alpha(x), beta, etc. They used the FLUKA Monte Carlo code and looked at different scenarios, including spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) in water and a clinical patient case. They varied parameters by percentages and compared biological doses estimated with different parameter sets from various cell lines and LEM versions. The results show that some parameters have more significant impacts on the biological dose distribution than others. For example, increasing r(d) by 25% decreased the center dose by 14%. They also found differences between MKM and LEM in terms of calculated biological doses. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of accurate input parameters for these models in treatment planning. Now, considering the topic is about AI applications in carbon ion therapy, I need to see if this article discusses any AI methods or techniques. From what I read, the focus is on sensitivity analysis of model parameters using Monte Carlo simulations but doesn't mention anything about artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, neural networks, etc. The models themselves are mathematical and physical models used in treatment planning, not AI-based approaches.

A normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for ARD in patients with head and neck cancer treated with carbon ion radiation therapy was developed.        Materials and methods: A total of 187 patients were included in the analysis, and the endpoint was >= grade 2 ARD. The biological and physical dose-surface parameters associated with ARD were used in the logistic regression model. The mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the internal cross-validation and Akaike's corrected Information Criterion were examined for model evaluation and selection. The multivariate logistic regression NTCP models were established based on factors with weak correlation.        Results: Tumor volume, planning target volume to the skin, radiation technique and all dose-surface parameters were significantly associated with ARD (P <.05). Models with high performance for grade 2 to 3 ARD were constructed. The most significant prognostic predictors were S-40 Gy (relative biological effectiveness,S- RBE) and S-20 Gy (absolute surface area receiving RBE-weighted dose of 40 Gy (RBE) or physical dose of 20 Gy). The internal cross-validation-based areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for models with S-40 Gy (RBE) and S-20 Gy were 0.78 and 0.77, respectively. The biological and physical dose-surface parameters had similar performance at various dose levels. However, the performance of the multivariate NTCP models based on 2 factors was not better than that of the univariate models.        Conclusions: NTCP models for ARD may provide a basis for the development of individualized treatment strategies and reduce the incidence of severe ARD in patients with head and neck cancer receiving carbon ion radiation therapy.

Methods: Treatment plans of 14 patients from the PACK-study were analyzed and recomputed in terms of physical, biological dose and dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd). Both LEM-I (local effect model 1) and the adapted NIRS-MKM (microdosimetric kinetic model), were used for relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose calculations (D-Bio vertical bar HIT and D-Bio vertical bar NIRS). A new constraint to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was derived from the National Institute of Radiological Science (NIRS) clinical experience and considered for plan reoptimization (DBio vertical bar NIRS-const48Gy and DBio vertical bar NIRS-const50.4Gy). The Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model of Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) for GI toxicity endpoints was computed. Furthermore, the computed LETd distribution was evaluated and correlated with Local Control (LC).        Results: Only two patients showed a LETd98% in the GTV greater than 44 keV/lm. A HIT-dose constraint to the GI of D-2cm3 = 48:6 Gy[RBE](HIT) was derived from the NIRS experience, in alternative to the standard at HIT D-max = 45.6 Gy[RBE](HIT). In comparison with the original D-Bio vertical bar HIT, DBiojNIRS-const48Gy and DBio vertical bar NIRS-const50.4Gy resulted in an increase in the ITV's D-98% of 8.7% and 11.3%.

Methods We analyzed 40 patients with PCA who received 16- or 12-fraction CIRT at our center. Linear-quadratic (LQ) and RBE-conversion models were employed to convert the constraints into various fractionations and biophysical models. Based on them, the MKM LQ strategy converted MKM rectum constraints for 16-fraction CIRT to 12-, 8-, and 4-fraction CIRT using the LQ model. Then, MKM constraints were converted to LEM using the RBE-conversion model. Meanwhile the LEM LQ strategy converted MKM rectum constraints for 16-fraction CIRT to LEM using the RBE-conversion model. Then, LEM constraints were converted from 16-fraction constraints to the rectum constraints for 12-, 8-, and 4-fraction CIRT using the LQ model. The LEM constraints for 16- and 12-fraction CIRT were evaluated using rectum doses and clinical follow-up. To adapt them for the MKM LQ strategy, CNAO LEM constraints were first converted to MKM constraints using the RBE-conversion model. Results The NIRS (i.e. D-MKM|v, V-20%, 10%, 5%, and 0%) and CNAO rectum constraints (i.e. D-LEM|v, V-10 cc, 5 cc, and 1 cc) were converted for 12-fraction CIRT using the MKM LQ strategy to LEM 37.60, 49.74, 55.27, and 58.01 Gy (RBE), and 45.97, 51.70, and 55.97 Gy (RBE), and using the LEM LQ strategy to 39.55, 53.08, 58.91, and 61.73 Gy (RBE), and 49.14, 55.30, and 59.69 Gy (RBE). We also established LEM constraints for 8- and 4-fraction CIRT. The 10-patient RBE-conversion model was comparable to 30-patient model. Eight patients who received 16-fraction CIRT exceeded the corresponding rectum constraints; the others were within the constraints. After a median follow-up of 10.8 months (7.1-20.8), No >= G1 late rectum toxicities were observed.

rayyan-1273750793,"NanOx, a new model to predict cell survival in the context of particle therapy","Particle therapy is increasingly attractive for the treatment of tumors and the number of facilities offering it is rising worldwide. Due to the well-known enhanced effectiveness of ions, it is of utmost importance to plan treatments with great care to ensure tumor killing and healthy tissues sparing. Hence, the accurate quantification of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of ions, used in the calculation of the biological dose, is critical. Nevertheless, the RBE is a complex function of many parameters and its determination requires modeling. The approaches currently used have allowed particle therapy to thrive, but still show some shortcomings. We present herein a short description of a new theoretical framework, NanOx, to calculate cell survival in the context of particle therapy. It gathers principles from existing approaches, while addressing some of their weaknesses. NanOx is a multiscale model that takes the stochastic nature of radiation at nanometric and micrometric scales fully into account, integrating also the chemical aspects of radiation-matter interaction. The latter are included in the model by means of a chemical specific energy, determined from the production of reactive chemical species induced by irradiation. Such a production represents the accumulation of oxidative stress and sublethal damage in the cell, potentially generating nonlocal lethal events in NanOx. The complementary local lethal events occur in a very localized region and can, alone, lead to cell death. Both these classes of events contribute to cell death. The comparison between experimental data and model predictions for the V79 cell line show a good agreement. In particular, the dependence of the typical shoulders of cell survival curves on linear energy transfer are well described, but also the effectiveness of different ions, including the overkill effect. These results required the adjustment of a number of parameters compatible with the application of the model in a clinical scenario thereby showing the potential of NanOx. Said parameters are discussed in detail in this paper.",0,,The article presents a new theoretical model for predicting cell survival in particle therapy but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

It's a multiscale model considering stochastic nature at nano and micro scales, including chemical aspects through reactive species production leading to oxidative stress and damage. They tested it with V79 cells and found good agreement with experimental data, especially regarding cell survival curves and ion effectiveness. The parameters are discussed for clinical application. Now, the key point is whether AI methods are involved here. The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning, neural networks, or other AI techniques. It's more about a theoretical model based on physics and chemistry principles.

rayyan-1273750800,Upper bound dose values for meson radiation in heavy-ion therapy,"Radiation treatment of cancer has evolved to include massive particle beams, instead of traditional irradiation procedures. Thus, patient doses and worker radiological protection have become issues of constant concern in the use of these new technologies, especially for proton-and heavy-ion-therapy. In the beam energies of interest of heavy-ion-therapy, secondary particle radiation comes from proton, neutron, and neutral and charged pions produced in the nuclear collisions of the beam with human tissue atoms. This work, for the first time, offers the upper bound of meson radiation dose in organic tissues due to secondary meson radiation in heavy-ion therapy. A model based on intranuclear collision has been used to follow in time the nuclear reaction and to determine the secondary radiation due to the meson yield produced in the beam interaction with nuclei in the tissue-equivalent media and water. The multiplicity, energy spectrum, and angular distribution of these pions, as well as their decay products, have been calculated in different scenarios for the nuclear reaction mechanism. The results of the produced secondary meson particles has been used to estimate the energy deposited in tissue using a cylindrical phantom by a transport Monte Carlo simulation and we have concluded that these mesons contribute at most 0.1% of the total prescribed dose.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods applied to carbon ion therapy; it focuses on dose estimation using Monte Carlo simulations and nuclear collision models.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750801,Adaptation of stochastic microdosimetric kinetic model for charged-particle therapy treatment planning,"The microdosimetric kinetic (MK) model underestimates the cell-survival fractions for high linear energy transfer (LET) and high dose irradiations. To address the issue, some researchers previously extended the MK model to the stochastic microdosimetric kinetic (SMK) model. In the SMK model, the radiation induced cell-survival fractions were estimated from the specific energies z(d) and z(n) absorbed by a microscopic subnuclear structure domain and a cell nucleus, respectively. By taking the stochastic nature of z(n) as well as that of z(d) into account, the SMK model could reproduce the measured cell-survival fractions for radiations with wide LET and dose ranges. However, treatment planning based on the SMK model was unrealistic in clinical practice due to its long computation time and huge memory space required for the computation. In this study, we modified the SMK model to shorten the computation time and to reduce the memory space required for the computation. By using the dose-averaged cell-nucleus specific energy per event (z)over-bar(n), D in the SMK formalism, the stochastic nature of z(n) was reflected onto the estimated cell-survival fractions. The accuracy of the modified SMK model was examined through the comparison between the estimated and the measured survival fractions of human salivary gland tumor cells and V79 cells. We then implemented the modified SMK model into the in-house treatment planning software for scanned charged-particle therapy to validate its applicability in clinical practice. As examples, treatment plans of helium-, carbon-, and neon-ion beams were made for an orbital tumor case. The modified SMK model could reproduce the measured cell-survival fractions more accurately compared to the MK model especially for high-LET and high-dose irradiations. In summary, the modified SMK model offers the accuracy and simplicity required in treatment planning of scanned charged-particle therapy for wide LET and dose ranges.",0,,The study focuses on modifying a microdosimetric kinetic model for treatment planning in charged-particle therapy but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls under the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Methods: The study retrieved dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI acquired prior to PBRT between 6/2015 and 3/2019 in 45 patients with HGG. Maximum nCBV (nCBVmax) within or adjacent to surgical/ tumor bed was measured using 'hot-spot' method. The predictive values of nCBVmax for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed in univariate Kaplan-Meier curve and multivariate Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models. Nomograms based on CPH results were constructed to individualize the predicted probability of OS and PFS. Results: The Kaplan-Meier curves and all CPH models based on nCBVmax as continuous variable (nCBVmax-C), group by cut-off derived from median value and Youden-index method showed that nCBVmax prior to radiotherapy was a strong predictor for both PFS and OS in HGG patients underwent PBRT. Nomograms built on CPH models showed similar excellent performance in both discrimination and calibration. Conclusions: Perfusion imaging prior to PBRT is a strong predictor of survival in HGG.

rayyan-1273750810,Organs at risk dose constraints in carbon ion radiotherapy at MedAustron: Translations between LEM and MKM RBE models and preliminary clinical results,"Background: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) treatment planning is based on relative biological effective-ness (RBE) weighted dose calculations. A large amount of clinical evidence for CIRT was collected in Japan with RBE estimated by the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) while all European centres apply the first version of the local effect model (LEM). Japanese schedules have been used in Europe with adapted prescription dose and organs at risk (OAR) dose constraints. Recently, less conservative adapted LEM constraints have been implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to analyse the new set of LEM dose constraints for brain parenchyma, brainstem and optic system considering both RBE models and evaluating early clinical data. Material and Methods: 31 patients receiving CIRT at MedAustron were analysed using the RayStation v9A planning system by recalculating clinical LEM-based plans in MKM. Dose statistics (D1cm(3), D5cm(3), D0.1cm(3), D0.7cm(3), D10%, D20%) were extracted for relevant critical OARs. Curve fitting for those values was performed, resulting in linear quadratic translation models. Clinical and radiological toxicity was evaluated. Results: Based on derived fits, currently applied LEM constraints matched recommended MKM constraints with deviations between-8% and +3.9%. For particular cases, data did not follow the expected LEM vs MKM trends resulting in outliers. Radiological (asymptomatic) toxicity was detected in two outlier cases. Conclusion: Respecting LEM constraints does not automatically ensure that MKM constraints are met. Constraints for both RBE models need to be fulfilled for future CIRT patients at MedAustron.

We also converted the LEM dose constraints (RBE-weighted dose constraints in LEM plans) for the brain stem, spinal cord, and optic nerve based on this curve. Methods Data from 20 patients with rNPC receiving carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in our hospital were collected. LEM in Raystation (V8A, Raystation, Sweden) was used to generate treatment plans. The clinical target volume CTV1 (GTV + 5 mm) was given 3 Gy (RBE) per fraction. Ninety-nine percent of target volumes should be covered by 95% of the prescriptions; the maximum doses of the brainstem and spinal cord were < 45 Gy (RBE) and < 30 Gy (RBE), respectively. The doses covering 20% volumes of optical nerves/chiasms D20 were < 30 Gy (RBE). Then physical doses of the LEM plans were recalculated by using MKM in Raystation to generate MKM plans. A series of conversion factors (i.e., the ratio of LEM RBE-weighted dose to MKM RBE-weighted dose) was then obtained by using an isovolumetric dose method. The LEM plan prescriptions (LEM prescription) and dose constraints of the organs at risk (OARs) (OAR constraints) were converted to the corresponding MKM prescriptions and dose constraints using this conversion curve. Results For the CTV1 fractional RBE-weighted dose prescription of 3.00 Gy (RBE) and CTV2 of 2.70 Gy (RBE) in LEM plans, the conversion factors (LEM RBE-weighted dose/MKM RBE-weighted dose) were 1.37 (CI 95% 1.35-1.39) and 1.46 (1.41-1.51), respectively. The average conversion factors from 1.37 (CI 95% 1.33-1.41) to 3.09 (2.94-3.24) corresponded to the LEM fractionated doses from 2.86 Gy (RBE) to 0.24 Gy (RBE), including the doses constraining upon OARs. LEM RBE-weighted doses of 30 Gy (RBE) and 45 Gy (RBE) in 21 fractions were converted to MKM RBE-weighted doses of 16.64 Gy (RBE) and 30.72 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions.

Especially in the case of incomplete tumor resection, prognosis remains poor. Heavy ion radiotherapy (HIT) and modern anticancer drugs like histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown promising effects in osteosarcoma in vitro. In this study, we tested the effect of HIT and the combination of HIT and the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in a xenograft mouse model.        Methods: Osteosarcoma xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of KHOS-24OS cells and treated with either vehicle (DMSO), SAHA, HIT or HIT and SAHA. Tumor growth was determined and tumor necrosis, proliferation rate, apoptotic rate as well as vessel density were evaluated.        Results: Here, we show that the combination of HIT and SAHA induced a significant delay of tumor growth through increased rate of apoptosis, increased expression of p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1), inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis compared to tumors treated with HIT only.

rayyan-1273750814,The relative biological effectiveness of carbon ion radiation therapy for early stage lung cancer,"Background and purpose: Carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) is recognized as an effective alternative treatment modality for early stage lung cancer, but a quantitative understanding of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compared to photon therapy is lacking. In this work, a mechanistic tumor response model previously validated for lung photon radiotherapy was used to estimate the RBE of CIRT compared to photon radiotherapy, as a function of dose and the fractionation schedule.        Materials and Methods: Clinical outcome data of 9 patient cohorts (394 patients) treated with CIRT for early stage lung cancer, representing all published data, were included. Fractional dose, number of fractions, treatment schedule, and local control rates were used for model simulations relative to standard photon outcomes. Four parameters were fitted: alpha, alpha/beta, and the oxygen enhancement ratios of cells either accessing only glucose, not oxygen (OERI), or cells dying from starvation (OERH). The resulting dose-response relationship of CIRT was compared with the previously determined dose-response relationship of photon radiotherapy for lung cancer, and an RBE of CIRT was derived.        Results: Best-fit CIRT parameters were: alpha = 1.12 Gy(-1) [95%-CI: 0.97-1.26], alpha/beta = 23.9 Gy [95%-CI: 8.9-38.9], and the oxygen induced radioresistance of hypoxic cell populations were characterized by OERI = 1.08 [95%-CI: 1.00-1.41] (cells lacking oxygen but not glucose), and OERH = 1.01 [95%-CI: 1.00-1.44] (cells lacking oxygen and glucose). Depending on dose and fractionation, the derived RBE ranges from 2.1 to 1.5, with decreasing values for larger fractional dose and fewer number of fractions.        Conclusion: Fitted radiobiological parameters were consistent with known carbon in vitro radiobiology, and the resulting dose-response curve well-fitted the reported data over a wide range of dose-fractionation schemes. The same model, with only a few fitted parameters of clear mechanistic meaning, thus synthesizes both photon radiotherapy and CIRT clinical experience with early stage lung tumors.

The abstract provided is about a study comparing carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) with photon therapy for early stage lung cancer. They used a tumor response model to estimate RBE and compared it with photon radiotherapy outcomes. The methods involved fitting parameters like alpha, alpha/beta, OERI, and OERH using clinical data from 394 patients across nine cohorts. The results showed that the RBE of CIRT varies between 2.1 and 1.5 depending on dose and fractionation schedules. They concluded that their model fits well with existing data and synthesizes both photon and CIRT experiences for early stage lung tumors. Now, I need to assess if this article falls under the scope of AI applications in carbon ion therapy. The abstract doesn't mention any AI methods or techniques like machine learning, neural networks, etc. It talks about a mechanistic tumor response model but that's more of a traditional radiobiological modeling approach rather than AI. Therefore, it seems this article isn't focused on applying AI in CIRT. So, the decision should be '0' because there are no AI methods explored here."
rayyan-1273750815,Implementation of a triple Gaussian beam model with subdivision and redefinition against density heterogeneities in treatment planning for scanned carbon-ion radiotherapy,"Challenging issues in treatment planning for scanned carbon-ion (C-ion) therapy are (i) accurate calculation of dose distribution, including the contribution of large angle-scattered fragments, (ii) reduction in the memory space required to store the dose kernel of individual pencil beams and (iii) shortening of computation time for dose optimization and calculation. To calculate the dose contribution from fragments, we modeled the transverse dose profile of the scanned C-ion beam with the superposition of three Gaussian distributions. The development of pencil beams belonging to the first Gaussian component was calculated analytically based on the Fermi-Eyges theory, while those belonging to the second and third components were transported empirically using the measured beam widths in a water phantom. To reduce the memory space for the kernels, we stored doses only in the regions of interest considered in the dose optimization. For the final dose calculation within the patient's whole body, we applied a pencil beam redefinition algorithm. With these techniques, the triple Gaussian beam model can be applied not only to final dose calculation but also to dose optimization in treatment planning for scanned C-ion therapy. To verify the model, we made treatment plans for a homogeneous water phantom and a heterogeneous head phantom. The planned doses agreed with the measurements within +/- 2% of the target dose in both phantoms, except for the doses at the periphery of the target with a high dose gradient. To estimate the memory space and computation time reduction with these techniques, we made a treatment plan for a bone sarcoma case with a target volume of 1.94 l. The memory space for the kernel and the computation time for final dose calculation were reduced to 1/22 and 1/100 of those without the techniques, respectively. Computation with the triple Gaussian beam model using the proposed techniques is rapid, accurate and applicable to dose optimization and calculation in treatment planning for scanned C-ion therapy.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods but focuses on a triple Gaussian beam model for dose calculation and optimization in scanned carbon-ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750819,Field size analysis of patient-specific quality assurance in scanned carbon ion radiotherapy,"Purpose To evaluate the dose difference between measurement and double Gaussian beam model prediction according to the field size and correct the measurements in patient-specific quality assurance (QA). Methods The field size dependence of the dose was evaluated with volumes of 20 x 20 x 80 mm(3), 40 x 40 x 80 mm(3), 60 x 60 x 80 mm(3), and 80 x 80 x 80 mm(3) of 1 Gy uniform dose at three depths. Additional two 80 x 80 x 80 mm(3) volumes of nonuniform fields were created: one high-dose field was given 1 Gy at the central 40 x 40 mm(2) and 0.5 Gy in its surrounding, and the other low-dose field was given 0.5 Gy in the middle and 1 Gy at the periphery. The dose in the center of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) was measured in a water phantom and compared with the treatment planning system (TPS) predication. A field factor based on the two-dimensional (2D) dose distribution was proposed to estimate the field size. The field factor was first evaluated against the dose difference in the square fields, and then used to analyze and correct the patient-specific QA results. Results TPS overestimated dose for fields smaller than 80 x 80 mm(2). A practically positive correlation was observed between the measured dose and the field factor. In the patient-specific QA, measured doses were lower than the TPS predication as they were calculated a relatively small field factor. The corrected dose differences were no longer field factor dependent. Conclusions Using the proposed field factor, we have shown that all the measurements with a large dose deviation were due to the small-sized field. It is clinically relevant to take into consideration the field size in the QA analysis as long as the double Gaussian beam model being used for the dose calculation. Correction to the measurement can be made based on the field factor.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods and focuses on field size analysis for quality assurance in scanned carbon ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The title mentions 'Field size analysis of patient-specific quality assurance in scanned carbon ion radiotherapy.' Hmm, that sounds like it's about optimizing or improving the QA process using some method related to field sizes. The purpose is to evaluate dose differences between measurements and model predictions based on field size and correct measurements in QA. So they're looking at how different field sizes affect the accuracy of dose calculations. They used volumes of varying sizes, measured doses, compared them with TPS predictions, and proposed a field factor based on 2D dose distribution. The results show that for smaller fields, TPS overestimates the dose, and there's a correlation between measured dose and field factor. In patient-specific QA, they found that measurements were lower than predictions because of small field factors, but after correction, the differences weren't dependent on field size anymore. They concluded that considering field size is important for QA when using the double Gaussian beam model. So, does this involve AI? The abstract doesn't mention any AI methods like machine learning, neural networks, or algorithms. It talks about a proposed field factor and evaluating it against dose differences, but that seems more like a statistical or physical correction method rather than an AI application. Since there's no indication of AI being used or developed in this study, I don't think it falls under the topic of applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. Therefore, it shouldn't be selected."

The proposed tracking approach is based on a patient-specific breathing motion model, estimated from the four-dimensional (4D) planning computed tomography (CT) through deformable image registration. The model is adapted to the interfraction baseline variations in the patient's anatomical configuration. The driving amplitude and phase parameters are obtained intrafractionally from a respiratory surrogate signal derived from the external surface displacement. The developed technique was assessed on a dataset of seven lung cancer patients, who underwent two repeated 4D CT scans. The first 4D CT was used to build the respiratory motion model, which was tested on the second scan. The geometric accuracy in localizing lung lesions, mediated over all breathing phases, ranged between 0.6 and 1.7 mm across all patients. Errors in tracking the surrounding organs at risk, such as lungs, trachea and esophagus, were lower than 1.3 mm on average. The median absolute variation in water equivalent path length (WEL) within the target volume did not exceed 1.9 mm-WEL for simulated particle beams. A significant improvement was achieved compared with error compensation based on standard rigid alignment. The present work can be regarded as a feasibility study for the potential extension of tumor tracking techniques in particle treatments. Differently from current tracking methods applied in conventional radiotherapy, the proposed approach allows for the dynamic localization of all anatomical structures scanned in the planning CT, thus providing complete information on density and WEL variations required for particle beam range adaptation.",0,,"The study does not explicitly explore or apply AI methods in the context of carbon ion therapy; instead, it focuses on a deformable motion model for organ tracking using external surrogates and prior motion models.","Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls under the topic of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

But wait, maybe deformable image registration is considered an AI method? I'm not entirely sure. If it's a traditional approach without machine learning elements, then perhaps it's not within the AI applications category.

rayyan-1273750823,RBE-weighted doses in target volumes of chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients treated with carbon ion radiotherapy: Comparison of local effect models I and IV,"Background and purpose: To compare the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose distributions in the target volume of chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients when using two different versions of the local effect model (LEM I vs. IV) under identical conditions.        Materials and methods: The patient collective included 59 patients treated with 20 fractions of carbon ion radiotherapy for chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma of the skull base at the Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in 2002 and 2003. Prescribed doses to the planning target volume (PTV) were 60 (n = 49), 66 (n = 2) and 70 (n = 8) Gy (RBE). The original treatment plans that were initially biologically optimized with LEM I, were now recalculated using LEM IV based on the absorbed dose distributions. The resulting RBE-weighted dose distributions were quantitatively compared to assess the clinical impact of LEM IV relative to LEM I in the target volume.        Results: LEM IV predicts 20-30 Gy (RBE) increased maximum doses as compared to LEM I, while minimum doses are decreased by 2-5 Gy (RBE). Population-based mean and median doses deviated by less than 2 Gy (RBE) between both models.        Conclusions: LEM I and LEM IV-based RBE-weighted doses in the target volume may be significantly different. Replacing the applied model in patient treatments may therefore lead to local over- or under-dosages in the tumor. If LEM IV is to be tested clinically, comparisons of the RBE-weighted dose distributions of both models are required for the individual patients to assess whether the LEM IV-plan would also be acceptable and prescribed dose as well as clinical outcome data have to be carefully reassessed.

rayyan-1273750824,Present developments in reaching an international consensus for a model-based approach to particle beam therapy,"Particle beam therapy (PBT), including proton and carbon ion therapy, is an emerging innovative treatment for cancer patients. Due to the high cost of and limited access to treatment, meticulous selection of patients who would benefit most from PBT, when compared with standard X-ray therapy (XRT), is necessary. Due to the cost and labor involved in randomized controlled trials, the model-based approach (MBA) is used as an alternative means of establishing scientific evidence in medicine, and it can be improved continuously. Good databases and reasonable models are crucial for the reliability of this approach. The tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability models are good illustrations of the advantages of PBT, but pre-existing NTCP models have been derived from historical patient treatments from the XRT era. This highlights the necessity of prospectively analyzing specific treatment-related toxicities in order to develop PBT-compatible models. An international consensus has been reached at the Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE) joint symposium, concluding that a systematically developed model is required for model accuracy and performance. Six important steps that need to be observed in these considerations include patient selection, treatment planning, beam delivery, dose verification, response assessment, and data analysis. Advanced technologies in radiotherapy and computer science can be integrated to improve the efficacy of a treatment.

Methods and Materials: Mouse carcinoma cell lines (LLC, LM8, Colon-26, and Colon-26MGS) were grafted into the right hind paw of syngeneic mice (C57BL/6J, C3H/He, and BALB/c). Seven days later, the tumors on the mice were locally irradiated with carbon ions (290 MeV/n, 6 cm spread-out Bragg peak, 1 or 2 Gy). At 1.5 days after irradiation, bone marrow-derived immature dendritic cells (iDCs) were administrated intravenously into a subset of the mice. The number of lung metastases was evaluated within 3 weeks after irradiation. In vitro-cultured cancer cells were irradiated with carbon ions (290 MeV/n, mono-energy, LET approximately 70-80 keV/mm), and then cocultured with iDCs for 3 days to determine the DC maturation.        Results: CiDC effectively repressed distant lung metastases in cancer cell (LLC and LM8)-bearing C57BL/6J and C3H/He mouse models. However, Colon-26- and Colon-26MGS-bearing BALB/c models did not show enhancement of metastasis suppression by combination treatment. This result was evaluated further by comparing LM8-bearing C3H/He and LLC-bearing C57BL/6J models with a Colon-26-bearing BALB/c model. In vitro coculture assays demonstrated that all irradiated cell lines were able to activate C3H/He-or C57BL/6J-derived iDCs into mature DCs, but not BALB/c-derived iDCs.

rayyan-1273750834,Validation of the relative biological effectiveness of active-energy scanning carbon-ion radiotherapy on a commercial treatment planning system with a microdosimetic kinetic model,"Background The study objective was to validate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) calculated by the modified microdosimetric kinetic model in RayStation (Ray-MKM) for active-energy scanning carbon-ion radiotherapy. Methods The Ray-MKM was benchmarked using a spread-out Bragg-peak (SOBP) plan, which was suggested in literature from the National Institute of Radiobiological Science (NIRS) in Japan. The residual RBE differences from the MKM at NIRS (NIRS-MKM) were derived using several SOBP plans with different ranges, SOBP widths, and prescriptions. To investigate the origins of the differences, we compared the saturation-corrected dose-mean specific energy Z(1D)(*) of the aforementioned SOBPs. Furthermore, we converted the RBE-weighted doses with the Ray-MKM to those with local effect model I (LEM doses). The purpose was to investigate whether the Ray-MKM could reproduce the RBE-weighted conversion study. Results The benchmark determined the value of the clinical dose scaling factor, F-clin, as 2.40. The target mean RBE deviations between the Ray-MKM and NIRS-MKM were median: 0.6 (minimum: 0.0 to maximum: 1.69) %. The Z(1D)(*) difference in-depth led to the RBE difference in-depth and was remarkable at the distal end. The converted LEM doses from the Ray-MKM doses were comparable (the deviation being - 1.8-0.7%) to existing literature.Conclusion This study validated the Ray-MKM based on our active-energy scanning carbon-ion beam via phantom studies. The Ray-MKM could generate similar RBEs as the NIRS-MKM after benchmarking. Analysis based on Z(1D)(*) indi-cated that the different beam qualities and fragment spectra caused the RBE differences. Since the absolute dose dif-ferences at the distal end were small, we neglected them.

However, evidence of using the pencil beam scanning (PBS) technique to treat moving liver tumors remains lacking. The present study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of PBS CIRT in patients with HCC.Methods: Between January 2016 and October 2021, 90 consecutive HCC patients treated with definitive CIRT in our center were retrospectively analyzed. Fifty-eight patients received relative biological effectiveness-weighted doses of 50-70 Gy in 10 fractions, and 32 received 60-67.5 Gy in 15 fractions, which were determined by the tumor location and normal tissue constraints. Active motion-management techniques and necessary strategies were adopted to mitigate interplay effects efficiently. Oncologic outcomes and toxicities were evaluated.Results: The median follow-up time was 28.6 months (range 5.7-74.6 months). The objective response rate was 75.0% for all 90 patients with 100 treated lesions. The overall survival rates at 1-, 2- and 3-years were 97.8%, 83.3% and 75.4%, respectively. The local control rates at 1-, 2- and 3-years were 96.4%, 96.4% and 93.1%, respectively. Radiation-induced liver disease was not documented, and 4 patients (4.4%) had their Child-Pugh score elevated by 1 point after CIRT. No grade 3 or higher acute non-hematological toxicities were observed. Six patients (6.7%) experienced grade 3 or higher late toxicities.Conclusion: The active scanning technique was clinically feasible to treat HCC by applying necessary mitigation measures for interplay effects.

However, the development of a TAT drug has been impeded due to numerous unsuccessful attempts to establish effective in vitro screening methods. The goal of this study was to construct a model to predict and optimize in vitro screening of potential TAT drugs. Based on mean field hypothesis, microdosimetry and the classic linear-quadratic equation, a novel model was built, which can predict our own in vitro experiments and replicate published data from others. Interestingly, this model can also be used to quickly optimize several key parameters in in vitro screening of potential TAT drugs, instructing the optimal combinations of the expression level of antigen, the binding affinity of antibody and drug antibody ratio, as well as others. In addition, to conveniently evaluate the therapeutic benefit of different drugs, a simple but universal parameter, the death ratio, is proposed. To our knowledge, this is the first model that can predict and guide the optimization of in vitro potential targeted alpha-particle therapy drug screening, which may then accelerate the development of potential targeted alpha-particle therapy drugs dramatically.

Material/methods: Clinical plans of 50 SC patients consecutively treated before August 2018 with a local effect model-based optimization were recalculated with the modified microdosimetric kinetic RBE model (mMKM). Twenty-six patients were classified as progressive disease and the relapse volume was contoured on the corresponding follow-up diagnostic sequence. The remaining 24 patients populated the control group. Target prescription dose (D-RBE vertical bar 50%), near-to -minimum-(D-RBE vertical bar 50%) and near-to-maximum(D-RBE vertical bar 50%) doses were compared between the two cohorts in both RBE systems. LETd distribution was evaluated for in-field relapsed cases with respect to the control group.        Results: Target D-MKM vertical bar 50% and D-MKM vertical bar 50% were respectively 10% and 18% lower than what we aimed at. Dosimetric evaluators showed no significant difference, in neither of the RBE frameworks, between relapsed and control sets. Half of the relapse volumes were located in a well-covered high dose region. On average, over these cases, median target LETd was significantly lower than the control cohort mean value (27 vs 30 keV/mu m). Most notably, the volume receiving dose from high-LET particles (>50 keV/mu m) lay substantially below recently reported data in the literature.

The methods section talks about classifying patients into progressive disease and control groups, evaluating dosimetric parameters in both RBE systems, and looking at LETd distributions. The results show some differences in target doses and LETd between the relapsed and control groups. They conclude that a combined multi-model approach could improve therapeutic ratios. Now, does this involve AI? The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning, neural networks, or other AI methods. It seems more focused on physics-based models like RBE and LET calculations rather than applying AI techniques. So, even though it's about carbon ion therapy, the application here isn't using AI but traditional modeling approaches. Therefore, I don't think this article falls within the scope of the topic."
rayyan-1273750845,Biological dose representation for carbon-ion radiotherapy of unconventional fractionation,"In carbon-ion radiotherapy, single-beam delivery each day in alternate directions has been common practice for efficient operation, taking advantage of the Bragg peak and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for uniform dose conformation to a tumor. Treatments are usually fractionated and treatment plans are evaluated with the total RBE-weighted dose; however, this is of limited relevance to the biological effect. In this study, we reformulate the biologically effective dose (BED) to normalize the dose-fractionation and cell-repopulation effects as well as the RBE of treating radiation, based on inactivation of a reference cell line by a reference carbon-ion radiation. The BED distribution virtually represents the biological effect of a treatment regardless of radiation modality or fractionation scheme. We applied the BED formulation to simplistic model treatments and to a preclinical survey for hypofractionation based on an actual prostate cancer treatment with carbon ions. The proposed formulation was demonstrated to be practical and to give theoretical implications. For a prostate cancer treatment in 12 fractions, the distributions of BED and of RBE-weighted dose were very similar. With hypofractionation, while the RBE-weighted dose distribution varied significantly, the BED distribution was nearly invariant, implying that carbonion radiotherapy would be effectively insensitive to fractionation. However, treatment evaluation with such a simplistic biological dose is intrinsically limited and must be complemented in practice by clinical experience and biological experiments.",0,[],The study does not explore or apply any AI methods in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750851,Brainstem NTCP and Dose Constraints for Carbon Ion RT-Application and Translation From Japanese to European RBE-Weighted Dose,"Background and Purpose        The Italian National Center of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO) has applied dose constraints for carbon ion RT (CIRT) as defined by Japan's National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS). However, these institutions use different models to predict the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). CNAO applies the Local Effect Model I (LEM I), which in most clinical situations predicts higher RBE than NIRS's Microdosimetric Kinetic Model (MKM). Equal constraints therefore become more restrictive at CNAO. Tolerance doses for the brainstem have not been validated for LEM I-weighted dose (D (LEM I)). However, brainstem constraints and a Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) model were recently reported for MKM-weighted dose (D (MKM)), showing that a constraint relaxation to D MKM|0.7 cm(3) <30 Gy (RBE) and D MKM|0.1 cm(3) <40 Gy (RBE) was feasible. The aim of this work was to evaluate the brainstem NTCP associated with CNAO's current clinical practice and to propose new brainstem constraints for LEM I-optimized CIRT at CNAO.        Material and Methods        We reproduced the absorbed dose of 30 representative patient treatment plans from CNAO. Subsequently, we calculated both D (LEM I) and D (MKM), and the relationship between D (MKM) and D (LEM I) for various brainstem dose metrics was analyzed. Furthermore, the NTCP model developed for D (MKM) was applied to estimate the NTCPs of the delivered plans.        Results        The translation of CNAO treatment plans to D (MKM) confirmed that the former CNAO constraints were conservative compared with D (MKM) constraints. Estimated NTCPs were 0% for all but one case, in which the NTCP was 2%. The relationship D (MKM)/D (LEM I) could be described by a quadratic regression model which revealed that the validated D (MKM) constraints corresponded to D LEM I|0.7 cm(3) <41 Gy (RBE) (95% CI, 38-44 Gy (RBE)) and D LEM I|0.1 cm(3) <49 Gy (RBE) (95% CI, 46-52 Gy (RBE)).        Conclusion        Our study demonstrates that RBE-weighted dose translation is of crucial importance in order to exchange experience and thus harmonize CIRT treatments globally. To mitigate uncertainties involved, we propose to use the lower bound of the 95% CI of the translation estimates, i.e., D LEM I|0.7 cm(3) <38 Gy (RBE) and D LEM I|0.1 cm(3) <46 Gy (RBE) as brainstem dose constraints for 16 fraction CIRT treatments optimized with LEM I.",0,,The article focuses on dose constraints and NTCP modeling in carbon ion therapy but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750852,Estimation of the medical need for carbon-ion radiotherapy in Korea,"The Korea Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator project focuses on the development of medical accelerator facilities for delivering carbon-ion beams to cancer patients. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the clinical need for carbon-ion therapy in Korea. Seven tumor sites, namely head and neck, liver, lung, colon and rectum, prostate, bone and soft tissue, and pancreas were selected as eligible sites for receiving carbon-ion radiotherapy (RT) by radiation oncologists of the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences. Cancer incidence data for the selected tumor sites were obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database in order to estimate the potential medical need for carbon-ion RT. The carbon-ion RT adaption rate was assessed based on the clinical experience of other carbon-ion therapy facilities. An estimation model was constructed for estimating the medical need for carbon-ion RT, and from this, 25 606 patients were deemed to be potential candidates for carbon-ion RT. This estimated potential need corresponded to 10% of newly diagnosed cancer patients in Korea. The realistic estimation was calculated as ranging between 4000 and 6300 patients, depending on the carbon-ion RT adaptation rate. This estimated medical need corresponded to 2-3% of newly diagnosed cancer patients in Korea. Taken together, our findings suggest that there is a clear medical need for carbon-ion RT in Korea, with at least 4000 potential patients per year.",0,,The abstract does not discuss any applications of AI in carbon ion therapy; it focuses on estimating medical need using data and models without mentioning AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750853,Dose prescription in carbon ion radiotherapy: How to compare two different RBE-weighted dose calculation systems,"Background and purpose: In carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), the use of different relative biological effectiveness (RBE) models in the RBE-weighted dose (D-RBE) calculation can lead to deviations in the physical dose (D-phy) delivered to the patient. Our aim is to reduce target D-phy deviations by converting prescription dose values.        Material and methods: Planning data of patients treated at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) were collected, with prescribed doses per fraction ranging from 3.6 Gy (RBE) to 4.6 Gy (RBE), according to the Japanese semi-empirical model. The D-phy was Monte Carlo (MC) re-calculated simulating the NIRS beamline. The local effect model (LEM)_I was then applied to estimate D-RBE. Target median D-RBE ratios between MC + LEM_I and NIRS plans determined correction factors for the conversion of prescription doses: Plans were re-optimized in a LEM_I-based commercial system, prescribing the NIRS uncorrected and corrected D-RBE.        Results: The MC + LEM_I target median D-RBE was respectively 15% and 5% higher than the NIRS reference, for the lowest and highest dose levels. Uncorrected D-RBE prescription resulted in significantly lower target Dphy in re-optimized plans, with respect to NIRS plans.        Conclusions: Prescription dose conversion factors could minimize target physical dose variations due to the use of different radiobiological models in the calculation of CIRT RBE-weighted dose.

rayyan-1273750854,Research on photogrammetry-based positioning of heavy ion radiotherapy and tumor target monitoring,"Heavy ion therapy is currently recognized as the most advanced cancer radiotherapy approach in the world. This article introduces a high-precision and non-contact measurement method based on close-range photogrammetry combined with a 3D control network of a laser tracker, which is used to guide the positioning and real-time target area monitoring for patients undergoing heavy ion radiotherapy. By the precise connection between the 3D control network of the laser tracker and the digital photogrammetry device, we position the photogrammetry system absolutely at the treatment isocenter, measuring the feature points of the target area on the patient's body surface. After that, the seven-parameter solution model is combined with the feature points to accurately determine the tumor position, as well as displaying its real-time location changes in the form of relative position to the treatment isocenter shown as six-degree-of-freedom parameters during radiotherapy, so that the patient may be guided to achieve a more reliable and efficient positioning. The research and design on the dual-camera close-range photogrammetry patient monitoring system has provided insights in the course of radiotherapy. That is to say, by monitoring the feature points on the patient's body surface, a real-time display of tumor displacement and a warning system for out-of-tolerance variances are established, controlling the treatment bed to stay on the tumor. This method could ensure the irradiation precision for the patient during the treatment and protect normal tissues from radiation exposure, optimizing the treatment outcome. Multiple patient positioning simulations have verified that the measurement precision of our photogrammetry-based method can meet the requirements of heavy ion radiotherapy patient positioning.",0,,The article focuses on photogrammetry-based positioning and tumor monitoring in heavy ion radiotherapy but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750855,Beam commissioning of a superconducting rotating-gantry for carbon-ion radiotherapy,"A superconducting rotating-gantry for carbon-ion radiotherapy was developed. This isocentric gantry can transport carbon ions having kinetic energies of between E=430 and 48 MeV/u to an isocenter over an angle of 180; and is further capable of performing. three-dimensional raster-scanning irradiation. Construction of the entire rotating-gantry system was completed by the end of September 2015. Prior to beam commissioning, phase-space distributions of extracted carbon beams from the synchrotron were deduced by using an empirical method. In this method, phase-space distributions at the extraction channel of the synchrotron were modeled with 8 parameters, and the best parameters were determined so as to minimize a difference between the calculated and measured beam profiles by using a simplex method. Based on the phase-space distributions, beam optics through the beam-transport lines as well as the rotating gantry were designed. Since horizontal and vertical beam emittances, as extracted slowly from the synchrotron, generally differ with each other, a horizontal-vertical beam coupling would occur when the gantry rotates. Thus, the size and shape of beam spots at the isocenter should vary depending on the gantry angle. To compensate for the difference in the emittances, we employed a method to utilize multiple Coulomb scattering of the beam particles by a thin scatterer. Having compensated for the emittances and designed beam optics through the rotating gantry, beam commissioning over various combinations of gantry angles and beam energies was performed. By finely tuning the superconducting quadrupoles of the rotating gantry, we could successfully obtain the designed beam quality, which satisfies the requirements of scanning irradiation.

They also talk about designing beam optics through transport lines and the gantry, compensating for emittances with Coulomb scattering, and tuning superconducting quadrupoles to achieve desired beam quality. The abstract doesn't explicitly mention machine learning, neural networks, or other typical AI terms, but it does use an optimization method (simplex) which is a computational technique that could fall under AI applications in this context. So maybe the article should be selected because it uses an AI-related method for beam commissioning and optimization. However, I'm not entirely sure if simplex method alone qualifies as AI application or if it's just a standard optimization technique. The topic specifically mentions AI, so perhaps only articles that use machine learning or similar methods would qualify. In this case, since the article doesn't explicitly mention AI techniques beyond an optimization algorithm, maybe it shouldn't be selected. Alternatively, if the simplex method is considered part of AI in this field, then it might be included. I need to decide based on whether the simplex method counts as an AI application here. If so, select; otherwise, don't."
rayyan-1273750857,A preliminary Monte Carlo study for the treatment head of a carbon-ion radiotherapy facility using TOPAS,"In medical physics it is desirable to have a Monte Carlo code that is less complex, reliable yet flexible for dose verification, optimization, and component design. TOPAS is a newly developed Monte Carlo simulation tool which combines extensive radiation physics libraries available in Geant4 code, easy-to-use geometry and support for visualization. Although TOPAS has been widely tested and verified in simulations of proton therapy, there has been no reported application for carbon ion therapy. To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of TOPAS simulations for carbon ion therapy, a licensed TOPAS code (version 3Op1) was used to carry out a dosimetric study of therapeutic carbon ions. Results of depth dose profile based on different physics models have been obtained and compared with the measurements. It is found that the G4QMD model is at least as accurate as the TOPAS default BIC physics model for carbon ions, but when the energy is increased to relatively high levels such as 400 MeV/u, the G4QMD model shows preferable performance. Also, simulations of special components used in the treatment head at the Institute of Modern Physics facility was conducted to investigate the Spread-Out dose distribution in water.

Plans were optimized using Local Effect Model-I (LEM-I), prescribed DRBE|LEM-I|D50% (median dose to HD-PTV) = 73.6 (70.4-76.8) Gy (RBE)/16 fractions. Sacral nerves were contoured between L5-S3 levels. DRBE|LEM-I to 5% of sacral nerves-to-spare (outside HD-CTV) (DRBE|LEM-I|D5%) were restricted to <69 Gy (RBE). The median follow-up was 25 months (range of 2-53). Three patients (9%) developed late RILSN (>= G3) after an average period of 8 months post-CIRT. The RILSN-free survival at 2 years was 91% (CI, 81-100). With SNSo-CIRT, DRBE|LEM-I|D5% for sacral nerves-to-spare = 66.9 +/- 1.9 Gy (RBE), maintaining DRBE|LEM-I to 98% of HD-CTV (DRBE|LEM-I|D98%) = 70 +/- 3.6 Gy (RBE).

rayyan-1273750861,Nuclear-interaction correction of integrated depth dose in carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning,"In treatment planning of charged-particle therapy, tissue heterogeneity is conventionally modeled as water with various densities, i.e. stopping effective densities rho(S), and the integrated depth dose measured in water (IDD) is applied accordingly for the patient dose calculation. Since the chemical composition of body tissues is different from that of water, this approximation causes dose calculation errors, especially due to difference in nuclear interactions. Here, we propose and validate an IDD correction method for these errors in patient dose calculations.        For accurate handling of nuclear interactions, rho(S) of the patient is converted to nuclear effective density rho(N), defined as the ratio of the probability of nuclear interactions in the tissue to that in water using a recently formulated semi-empirical relationship between the two. The attenuation correction factor phi(p)(w), defined as the ratio of the attenuation of primary carbon ions in a patient to that in water, is calculated from a linear integration of rho(N) along the beam path. In our treatment planning system, a carbon-ion beam is modeled to be composed of three components according to their transverse beam sizes: primary carbon ions, heavier fragments, and lighter fragments. We corrected the dose contribution from primary carbon ions to IDD as proportional to phi(p)(w), and corrected that from lighter fragments as inversely proportional to phi(p)(w). We tested the correction method for some non-water materials, e.g. milk, lard, ethanol and water solution of potassium phosphate (K2HPO4), with un-scanned and scanned carbon-ion beams.        In un-scanned beams, the difference in IDD between a beam penetrating a 150 mm-thick layer of lard and a beam penetrating water of the corresponding thickness amounted to -4%, while it was +6% for a 150 mm-thick layer of 40% K2HPO4. The observed differences were accurately predicted by the correction method. The corrected IDDs agreed with the measurements within +/- 1% for all materials and combinations of them. In scanned beams, the dose estimation error in target dose amounted to 4% for a 150 mm-thick layer of 40% K2HPO4. The error is significantly reduced with the correction method. The planned dose distributions with the method agreed with the measurements within +/- 1.5% of target dose for all materials not only in the target region but also in the plateau and fragment-tail regions.

PD-L1 also represents a potent biomarker for in vivo molecular imaging using radiolabeled anti-PD-L1 mAbs and positron emission tomography and is currently in development to select patients and assess response to treatment. The aim of our study was to investigate in a preclinical model of human melanoma if PD-L1 could also be a good target for treatment using targeted alpha-particle therapy. Our results show that targeting PD-L1 with bismuth-213, an alpha particle emitter, was associated with efficient anti-tumor response, significant tumor growth delay, and improved survival. This demonstrates that anti-PD-L1 antibodies could be used as theranostics in molecular imaging but also in targeted alpha-particle therapy to treat the tumor and its stroma.        PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1, B7-H1, CD274), the ligand for PD-1 inhibitory receptor, is expressed on various tumors, and its expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in melanoma. Anti-PD-L1 mAbs have been developed along with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, and anti-PD-1 mAbs are now used as first line treatment in melanoma. However, many patients do not respond to ICI therapies, and therefore new treatment alternatives should be developed. Because of its expression on the tumor cells and on immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment, PD-L1 represents an interesting target for targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT). We developed a TAT approach in a human melanoma xenograft model that stably expresses PD-L1 using a Bi-213-anti-human-PD-L1 mAb. Unlike treatment with unlabeled anti-human-PD-L1 mAb, TAT targeting PD-L1 significantly delayed melanoma tumor growth and improved animal survival. A slight decrease in platelets was observed, but no toxicity on red blood cells, bone marrow, liver or kidney was induced. Anti-tumor efficacy was associated with specific tumor targeting since no therapeutic effect was observed in animals bearing PD-L1 negative melanoma tumors. This study demonstrates that anti-PD-L1 antibodies may be used efficiently for TAT treatment in melanoma.",0,,"The study focuses on PD-L1 targeted alpha-particle therapy, which is unrelated to AI or carbon ion therapy.","Okay, so I need to determine whether this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Carbon ions are heavier and have different physical properties when used in radiation therapy. The article discusses using bismuth-213 as an alpha particle emitter attached to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. They tested this in a melanoma model and found it effective with minimal toxicity. There's mention of theranostics, which combines therapy and diagnostics, but that doesn't necessarily tie into AI or carbon ions. The methods used here are more about targeted radionuclide therapy rather than any AI techniques or carbon ion applications.

Little is known about the difference in lymphopenia between intensity modulated (photon) radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton and carbon ion radiation therapy (PCIRT). This study aimed to investigate lymphopenia differences between IMRT and PCIRT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).        Methods and Materials: Clinical and dosimetric parameters were collected from 343 patients who received definitive IMRT or PCIRT for NSCLC. Severe lymphopenia (SRL) was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <= 0.5 x 10(3) cells/mL. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Propensity score matching was performed between the IMRT and PCIRT groups. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis was used to select appropriate dosimetric parameters. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of SRL.        Results: Compared with the IMRT group, the PCIRT group was less likely to develop SRL (P < .001). Compared with the non-SRL group, the SRL group showed significant association with poorer OS, with a median survival time of 29.2 versus 15.0 months (P = .046). IMRT was an independent risk factor of SRL (P = .004). A lower ALC before RT (P = .030) and larger planning target volume (PTV) (P = .002) were also significant independent risk factors for SRL. Moreover, the majority of dosimetric parameters of organs at risk in PCIRT were lower than those in IMRT (P < .001). Thoracic vertebra V5 (P = .002) and aorta V5 (P = .026) were identified as independent risk predictors of SRL after adding dosimetric parameters to the regre        ssion model. Conclusions: Compared with IMRT, PCIRT could reduce SRL incidence, possibly by limiting thoracic vertebra and aortic doses, and SRL was associated with poor outcomes in patients with NSCLC.

Basic research suggests that the strong cell-killing effect induced by carbon ions is based on their ability to cause complex DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, evidence supporting the formation of complex DSBs in actual patients is lacking. Here, we used advanced high-resolution microscopy with deconvolution to show that complex DSBs are formed in a human tumor clinically treated with carbon ion radiotherapy, but not in a tumor treated with X-ray radiotherapy. Furthermore, analysis using a physics model suggested that the complexity of radiotherapy-induced DSBs is related to linear energy transfer, which is much higher for carbon ion beams than for X-rays. Visualization of complex DSBs in clinical specimens will help us to understand the anti-tumor effects of carbon ion radiotherapy.",0,[],The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on microscopy and physics model analysis for visualizing DNA breaks.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750868,Dosimetric effect of variable rectum and sigmoid colon filling during carbon ion radiotherapy to sacral chordoma,"Purpose: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is sensitive to anatomical density variations. We examined the dosimetric effect of variable intestinal filling condition during CIRT to ten sacral chordoma patients.        Methods: For each patient, eight virtual computed tomography scans (vCTs) were generated by varying the density distribution within the rectum and the sigmoid in the planning computed tomography (pCT) with a density override approach mimicking a heterogeneous combination of gas and feces. Totally full and empty intestinal preparations were modelled. In addition, five different intestinal filling conditions were modelled by a mixed density pattern derived from two combined and weighted Gaussian distributions simulating gas and feces respectively. Finally, a patient-specific mixing proportion was estimated by evaluating the daily amount of gas detected in the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Dose distribution was recalculated on each vCT and dose volume histograms (DVHs) were examined.        Results: No target coverage degradation was observed at different vCTs. Rectum and sigma dose degradation ranged respectively between: [-6.7; 21.6]GyE and [-0.7; 15.4]GyE for D-50%; [-377.4; 1197.9] and [-95.2; 1027.5] for AUC; [-1.2; 10.7]GyE and [-2.6; 21.5]GyE for D-1%.        Conclusions: Variation of intestinal density can greatly influence the penetration depth of charged particle and might compromise dose distribution. In particular cases, with large clinical target volume in very close proximity to rectum and sigmoid colon, it is appropriate to evaluate the amount of gas present in the daily CBCT images even if it is totally included in the reference planning structures.",0,,The study examines the impact of variable intestinal filling on dose distribution during CIRT but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully. The title is about the dosimetric effect of variable rectum and sigmoid colon filling during carbon ion radiotherapy for sacral chordoma. The purpose mentions that CIRT is sensitive to anatomical density variations, so they looked at how different intestinal fillings affect dose distribution. They used virtual CT scans with varying densities mimicking gas and feces. They also modeled full, empty, and mixed conditions using Gaussian distributions. Then, they estimated patient-specific mixing proportions based on daily CBCT images. The results showed significant variations in rectum and sigmoid doses. The conclusion suggests evaluating gas amounts in CBCT even if structures are included in planning. Now, looking for AI methods: the abstract doesn't mention any machine learning, algorithms, or computational models beyond statistical analysis like Gaussian distributions. They used density override approaches and evaluated data but didn't apply AI techniques. So this is more about dosimetry variations due to anatomical changes rather than applying AI in therapy planning or optimization. Therefore, it's not an original research article on AI applications in carbon ion therapy."

We conducted a retrospective nationwide multicentre study to evaluate the clinical outcomes of CIRT for sacral chordoma in Japan.        Materials and methods: A total of 219 patients who underwent CIRT for sacral chordoma at institutions across Japan between December 2003 and July 2014 were included in this study.        Results: Median patient age was 67 years (range, 26-87 years). Most patients had no history of surgical resection (96%). The most frequent planning target volume (PTV) range was 100-500 mL (65%). The most frequently used dose-fractionation was 67.2 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions (65%). The median follow-up was 56 months (range, 7-132 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and local control rates were 84%, 48%, and 72%, respectively. Frequent sites of out-of-field recurrence included bone (9%) and lung (9%) metastases. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed that both younger age (P = 0.004) and smaller PTV (P = 0.001) were associated with significantly better OS. Acute toxicities of >= Grade 3 occurred in eight patients (4%). Late toxicities of >= Grade 3 occurred in 13 patients (6%): skin disorders in six patients (3%), pain in three (1%), myositis in three (1%), etc.        Conclusion: Our retrospective nationwide multicentre study showed that CIRT for sacral chordoma was effective and safe, and replicated the previously reported data from a representative CIRT institution in Japan demonstrating high local control and low toxicity rates.

rayyan-1273750870,A numerical method to optimise the spatial dose distribution in carbon ion radiotherapy planning,"The authors describe a numerical algorithm to optimise the entrance spectra of a composition of pristine carbon ion beams which delivers a pre-assumed dose-depth profile over a given depth range within the spread-out Bragg peak. The physical beam transport model is based on tabularised data generated using the SHIELD-HIT10A Monte-Carlo code. Depth-dose profile optimisation is achieved by minimising the deviation from the pre-assumed profile evaluated on a regular grid of points over a given depth range. This multi-dimensional minimisation problem is solved using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, with parallel processing support. Another multi-dimensional interpolation algorithm is used to calculate at given beam depths the cumulative energy-fluence spectra for primary and secondary ions in the optimised beam composition. Knowledge of such energy-fluence spectra for each ion is required by the mixed-field calculation of Katz's cellular Track Structure Theory (TST) that predicts the resulting depth-survival profile. The optimisation algorithm and the TST mixed-field calculation are essential tools in the development of a one-dimensional kernel of a carbon ion therapy planning system. All codes used in the work are generally accessible within the libamtrack open source platform.",0,,The article describes numerical optimization algorithms but does not employ AI methods in carbon ion therapy applications.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls under the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

In this study, the integrated depth-dose-distributions (IDDDs) of 190 MeV/u and 260 MeV/u carbon beams in the active spot-scanning delivery system were measured and calculated by FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation based on the Heavy Ion Medical Machine (HIMM). Considering the dose distributions caused by secondary particles and scattering, we also used different types of pencil beam (PB) models to fit and compare the spatial distributions of PB. We superposed a bunch of PB to form a 20x20 cm(2) treatment field with the double Gaussian and double Gaussian logistic beam models and calculated the influence of beam delivery error on the field flatness and penumbra, respectively. The simulated IDDDs showed good agreement with the measured values. The triple Gaussian and double Gaussian logistic beam models have good fitness to the simulated dose distributions.

Alpha-particle induced DNA damage can elicit an immune response that results in T-cell activation against tumor cells; however, tumor cells can evade immune surveillance through expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Therefore, we investigated the effects of alpha particle therapy in combination with immune-checkpoint blockade using astatine-211MM4 and anti-programmed death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) immunotherapy in a syngeneic mouse model of glioblastoma. We characterized the sensitivity of four human glioblastoma cell lines to [At-211]MM4 in vitro. To evaluate [At-211]MM4 treatment effects on hematological tissues, complete blood counts were performed after a single dose at 12, 24, or 36 MBq/kg. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a syngeneic mouse model of glioblastoma using GL26 glioblastoma cells in CB57BL/6J mice treated with either 36 MBq/kg [At-211]MM4, anti-PD-1 antibody, or a combination of the two. Following a single dose of [At-211]MM4, lymphocytes are significantly decreased compared to control at both 72 h and 1 week following treatment followed by recovery of counts by 2 weeks. However, neutrophils showed an increase with all dose levels of [At-211]MM4 exhibiting higher levels than control. The average best tumor responses for combination, anti-PD-1, and [At-211]MM4 were 100%, 83.6%, and 58.2% decrease in tumor volume, respectively. Average progression free intervals for combination, anti-PD-1, [At-211]MM4, and control groups was 65, 36.4, 23.2, and 3 days, respectively. The percentages of disease-free mice at the end of the study for combination and anti-PD-1 were 100% and 60%, while [At-211]MM4 and control groups were both 0%. In summary, combination therapy was more effective than either single agent in all response categories analyzed, highlighting the potential for PARP targeted alpha-therapy to enhance PD-1 immune-checkpoint blockade.",0,,"The article discusses PARP targeted alpha-particle therapy and its combination with PD-1 immune-checkpoint blockade in a glioblastoma model, which does not relate to carbon ion therapy or AI applications.","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Results: Available technological capabilities for motion surveillance and compensation determined the course of each 4D particle treatment. 4D motion management, delivery techniques and strategies including imaging were diverse and depended on many factors. These included aspects of motion amplitude, tumour location, as well as accelerator technology driving the necessity of centre-specific dosimetric validation. Novel methodologies for Xray based image processing and MRI for real-time tumour tracking and motion management were shown to have a large potential for online and offline adaptation schemes compensating for potential anatomical changes over the treatment course.

In this study, we investigated the safety of carbon-ion beam therapy in patients with CIEDs. Patients with CIEDs who underwent carbon-ion therapy at Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center between June 2010 and December 2019 were identified and investigated for abnormalities in the operation of their CIEDs, such as oversensing and resetting during irradiation, and abnormalities in operation after treatment. In addition, the risk of irradiation from carbon-ion beam therapy was evaluated by model simulations. Twenty patients (22 sites) with CIEDs were identified, 19 with pacemakers and one with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Treatments were completed without any problems, except for one case in which the treatment was discontinued because of worsening of the primary disease. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that the carbon beam irradiation produced neutrons at a constant and high level in the irradiation field. Nevertheless, with the distances between the CIEDs and the irradiation fields in the analyzed cases, the quantity of neutrons at the CIEDs was lower than that within the irradiation. Although carbon-ion beam therapy can be safely administered to patients with CIEDs, it is advisable to perform the therapy with sufficient preparation and backup devices because of the risks involved.",0,,The study focuses on safety verification of carbon-ion therapy in patients with CIEDs but does not explore any AI methods or applications.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

In case of recurrence of rectal cancer after pelvic photon beam radiotherapy, carbon ion radiotherapy may be an option. In this study, the authors looked at the potential role of specific MRI sequences performed before treatment to predict response to carbon ion radiotherapy. If confirmed in a larger prospective cohort, the findings of this study may drive clinical decisions toward a more tumor- and patient-tailored therapeutic approach.        Aim: To evaluate the association between pretreatment diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and 12-month radiological response in locally recurrent rectal cancer treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. Methods: Histogram analysis was performed on pretreatment DW-MRI for patients re-irradiated with carbon ion radiotherapy for local recurrence of rectal cancer.

rayyan-1273750885,Carbon ion radiotherapy boosts anti-tumour immune responses by inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells in melanoma-bearing mice,"Numerous studies have shown that carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) induces anti-cancer immune responses in melanoma patients, yet the mechanism remains elusive. The abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumour microenvironment is associated with therapeutic efficacy and disease outcome. This study analysed the changes in the immune contexture in response to the carbon ion treatment. The murine melanoma B16, MelanA, and S91 tumour models were established in syngeneic immunocompetent mice. Then, the tumours were irradiated with carbon ion beams, and flow cytometry was utilised to observe the immune contexture changes in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, spleen, and tumours. The immune infiltrates in the tumour tissues were further assessed using haematoxylin/eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. The immunoblot detected the expression of proteins associated with the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. The secretion of immune-related cytokines was examined using ELISA. Compared to conventional radiotherapy, particle beams have distinct advantages in cancer therapy. Here, the use of carbon ion beams (5 GyE) for melanoma-bearing mice was found to reduce the population of MDSC in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen of the animals via a JAK2/STAT3-dependent mechanism. The percentage of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells increased after radiation, resulting in reduced tumour growth and prolonged overall survival in the three different mouse models of melanoma.

To overcome inefficiencies and interplay effects between the residual motion of the target and the scanned heavy-ion beam delivery process for conventional free breathing (FB)-based gating therapy, a novel respiratory guidance method was developed to help patients synchronize their breathing patterns with the synchrotron excitation patterns by performing short breath holds with the aid of personalized audiovisual biofeedback (BFB) system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment precision, efficiency and reproducibility of the respiratory guidance method in scanned heavy-ion beam delivery mode. Using 96 breathing traces from eight healthy volunteers who were asked to breathe freely and guided to perform short breath holds with the aid of BFB, a series of dedicated four-dimensional dose calculations (4DDC) were performed on a geometric model which was developed assuming a linear relationship between external surrogate and internal tumor motions. The outcome of the 4DDCs was quantified in terms of the treatment time, dose-volume histograms (DVH) and dose homogeneity index. Our results show that with the respiratory guidance method the treatment efficiency increased by a factor of 2.23-3.94 compared with FB gating, depending on the duty cycle settings. The magnitude of dose inhomogeneity for the respiratory guidance methods was 7.5 times less than that of the non-gated irradiation, and good reproducibility of breathing guidance among different fractions was achieved. Thus, our study indicates that the respiratory guidance method not only improved the overall treatment efficiency of respiratory-gated scanned heavy-ion beam delivery, but also had the advantages of lower dose uncertainty and better reproducibility among fractions.",0,,The study focuses on respiratory-gated radiotherapy with biofeedback but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls under the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273750887,Uncertainty in the range of the protons and C-ions in particle therapy due to a hydration level of a human body model,"Cancer treatment with protons and carbon ions relies on the property of the accelerated charged particles to deposit most of their energy in the vicinity of their range (around the Bragg peak). The level of hydration in a cancer patient's body may vary within hours. Some patients may be heavy to moderately dehydrated, and some may be well and even excessively hydrated. In this research, we aim to estimate the uncertainty of the protons and C-ion ranges because of the different hydration levels of the human body. For the study of the impact of body hydration level on the particle's ranges, we have designed a new phantom model - a homogeneous mixture of an Average HUuman BOdy constituting elements (AHUBO) in three states of hydration: normal (n), dehydrated (d), and excessively hydrated (e) by applying corresponding recalibration in the ""atomic-stoichiometry model"" due to the water sufficiency/deficiency. The purpose of the study is to estimate the shift in the ranges depending on the hydration level, possibly suggest particle beam energy adjustments to overcome the range uncertainties, to deliver the prescribed dose to the tumour while sparing the healthy tissue. Herein we present the results of the FLUKA-Flair simulations of the therapeutic range of energies of protons (50-105 MeV) and C-ions (30-210 MeV) respectively, into an AHUBO head phantom model at three levels of hydration (normal, dehydrated, and excessively hydrated). The range uncertainty was estimated via the shifts of the Bragg-peaks position for the three different hydration levels. The estimations showed that the range uncertainty (& UDelta;R) due to body hydration for the maximum energy in the range for protons at 105 MeV is about 0.04 mm and for C-ions at 190 MeV/u is about 0.06 mm.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods but focuses on physical simulations related to particle therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Despite novel approaches, HCC with MVI has a poor prognosis compared to early-to intermediate-stage HCC. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for HCC characterized by MVI.Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated HCC patients with MVI treated using C-ion RT with a dose of 45.0-48.0 Gy/2 fractions or 52.8-60.0 Gy/4 fractions between 1995 and 2020 at our institution in Japan. We analyzed the prognostic factors and rates of local recurrence, survival, and adverse events. The local recurrence rate was determined using the cumulative incidence function, with death as a competing event. Survival rates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test for univariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis were used to compare subgroups.Results In total, 76 patients with a median age of 71 years (range, 45-86 years) were evaluated. Among them, 68 had Child-Pugh grade A while eight had grade B disease. In 17 patients, the vascular tumor thrombus reached the inferior vena cava or main trunk of the portal vein. Over a median follow-up period of 27.9 months (range, 1.5-180.4 months), the 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and local recurrence rates were 70.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.7-79.4%), 32.7% (95% CI: 22.0-43.8%), and 8.9% (95% CI: 1.7-23.5%), respectively. A naive tumor and a single lesion were significant prognostic factors for overall survival in the univariate analysis. Albumin-bilirubin grade 1 and a single lesion were independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Overall, four patients (5%) experienced grade 3 late adverse events, with no observed grade 4 or 5 acute or late adverse events.Conclusions C-ion RT for HCC with MVI showed favorable local control and survival benefits with minimal toxicity.",0,[],The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their applications in carbon-ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Methods: Three sublines of syngeneic rat prostate tumors (R3327) with various differentiation levels (highly (-H), moderately (-HI) or anaplastic (-AT1), (diameter 10 mm) were irradiated with 1, 2 and 6 fractions of either C-12-ions or 6 MV photons using increasing dose levels. Primary endpoint was local tumor control at 300 days. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-12-ions was calculated from TCD50-values (dose at 50% tumor control probability) of photons and C-12-ions and correlated with intrinsic tumor parameters. For the HI-subline, larger tumors (diameter 18 mm) were irradiated with either carbon ions, oxygen ions or photons under ambient as well as hypoxic conditions to determine the variability of the RBE under different oxygenation levels. In addition, imaging, histology and molecular analyses were performed to decipher the underlying mechanisms.        Results: Experimental results revealed (i) a smaller variation of the TCD50-values between the three tumor sublines for C-12-ions (23.6-32.9 Gy) than for photons (38.2-75.7 Gy), (ii) steeper dose-response curves for C-12-ions, and (iii) an RBE that increased with tumor grading (1.62 +/- 0.11 (H) vs 2.08 +/- 0.13 (HI) vs 2.30 +/- 0.08 (AT1)). Large HI-tumors resulted in a marked increase of TCD50, which was increased further by 15% under hypoxic relative to oxic conditions. Noninvasive imaging, histology and molecular analyses identified hypoxia as an important radioresistance factor in photon therapy.        Conclusions: The dose-response studies revealed a higher efficacy of C-12-ions relative to photon therapy in the investigated syngeneic tumor model. Hypoxia turned out to be at least one important radioresistance factor, which can be partly overridden by high-LET ion beams. This might be used to increase treatment effectiveness also in patients. The results of this project served as a starting point for several ongoing research projects.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods; it focuses on experimental studies comparing carbon ion and photon irradiation effects on tumor control without AI involvement.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given abstract falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully. The title is about carbon ion radiotherapy and its impact on tumor differentiation in experimental prostate carcinomas. The background mentions a clinical research group funded by DFG, focusing on intrinsic tumor characteristics like grading and hypoxia after carbon ion or photon irradiations. The methods involve using different fractions of C-12 ions and photons on various tumor sublines, measuring local tumor control at 300 days. They calculated RBE from TCD50 values and looked into how it correlates with tumor parameters. For the HI-subline, they tested under hypoxic conditions as well. Results showed smaller variation in TCD50 for C-12 ions compared to photons, steeper dose-response curves, and increasing RBE with tumor grading. They also found that hypoxia increased TCD50 further. Imaging, histology, and molecular analyses were done to understand mechanisms, identifying hypoxia as a radioresistance factor in photon therapy but less so with high-LET ion beams. Conclusions suggest higher efficacy of C-12 ions and the role of hypoxia in treatment resistance, which might be addressed by carbon ions. The results are part of ongoing research projects. Now, looking for any mention or implication of AI methods. The abstract discusses experimental studies, biological effects, RBE calculations, but nowhere do they mention machine learning, algorithms, predictive models, data analysis techniques beyond standard statistical methods. It's more about the biological impact and effectiveness of carbon ions versus photons, not about applying AI in therapy planning, patient outcomes prediction, or treatment optimization. Therefore, this article doesn't fall under applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. So, I should select '0' as it doesn't meet the criteria."

MethodsClinical data and treatment plans of ACC patients, consecutively treated from January 2013 to September 2016 within the phase II clinical trial CNAO S9/2012/C, were retrospectively reviewed. ORN and other treatment-related toxicity were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTACE), version 4.0. The maxillary bone was contoured on the planning CT, and only patients receiving more than 10% of the prescription dose at their maxilla were considered for the analysis (67 patients). The volumes of maxilla receiving doses from 10 Gy (RBE) to 60 Gy (RBE) (V-D), with an increment of 10 Gy (RBE), and additional clinical factors were correlated to the incidence of ORN with univariate analysis (Chi-square test). The logistic regression model was subsequently applied for multivariate analysis. Treatment plans calculated with a local effect model (LEM)-based optimization were recalculated with the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM), and compared with literature data from the Japanese experience. ResultsThe median time interval from the start of CIRT to ORN appearance was 24 months (range, 8-54 months). Maxillary ORN was observed in 11 patients (16.4%). Grade 1 ORN was observed in 2 patients (18.1%), G2 in 4 (36.3%), G3 in 4 (36.3%) and G4 in 1 (9.3%). From univariate analysis, the site of the tumor, the presence of teeth within the PTV and acute mucositis correlated with the development of maxillary ORN. V-D were significantly higher for all the dose levels tested in patients with maxillary ORN than patients without necrosis, according to both radiobiological models. The multivariate analysis showed that V60 significantly correlated with ORN risk. ConclusionThe volume of maxilla irradiated with high dose values was relevant for ORN development in our cohort of ACC patients. These results are in line with previously published data obtained with a different radiobiological model. Our findings might be helpful to prevent the risk of ORN in patients receiving CIRT.",0,[],The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on traditional statistical analysis and radiobiological modeling without AI involvement.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273750893,Planning Strategy to Optimize the Dose-Averaged LET Distribution in Large Pelvic Sarcomas/Chordomas Treated with Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy,"To improve outcomes in large sarcomas/chordomas treated with CIRT, there has been recent interest in LET optimization. We evaluated 22 pelvic sarcoma/chordoma patients treated with CIRT [large: HD-CTV >= 250 cm3 (n = 9), small: HD-CTV < 250 cm3 (n = 13)], DRBE|LEM-I = 73.6 (70.4-73.6) Gy (RBE)/16 fractions, using the local effect model-I (LEM-I) optimization and modified-microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM) recomputation. We observed that to improve high-LETd distribution in large tumors, at least 27 cm3 (low-LETd region) of HD-CTV should receive LETd of >= 33 keV/mu m (p < 0.05). Hence, LETd optimization using 'distal patching' was explored in a treatment planning setting (not implemented clinically yet). Distal-patching structures were created to stop beams 1-2 cm beyond the HD-PTV-midplane. These plans were reoptimized and DRBE|LEM-I, DRBE|mMKM, and LETd were recomputed. Distal patching increased (a) LETd50% in HD-CTV (from 38 +/- 3.4 keV/mu m to 47 +/- 8.1 keV/mu m), (b) LETdmin in low-LETd regions of the HD-CTV (from 32 +/- 2.3 keV/mu m to 36.2 +/- 3.6 keV/mu m), (c) the GTV fraction receiving LETd of <= 50 keV/mu m, (from <10% to >50%) and (d) the high-LETd component in the central region of the GTV, without significant compromise in DRBE distribution. However, distal patching is sensitive to setup/range uncertainties, and efforts to ascertain robustness are underway, before routine clinical implementation.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods but focuses on LET optimization techniques in carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750895,Lethal and nonlethal chromosome aberrations by gamma rays and heavy ions: a cytogenetic perspective on dose fractionation in hadron radiotherapy,"Background: With ions heavier than protons now being used in radiotherapy, consideration has been given to the use of fewer dose fractions. Because it is among the best surrogate measures of cell killing and carcinogenic potential, damage to chromosomes relates to the clinical objectives of minimizing normal tissue damage, and lessening the chance of treatment-related second cancers. Curvature in acute dose response relationships plays an important role in radiotherapy, since it implies that a dose-fractionation effect will be observed.        Methods: Human lymphocytes, irradiated with either 662 keV Cs-137 gamma rays or 1 GeV/amu Fe-56 ions, were assessed for chromosome aberrations at their first postirradiation mitosis by mFISH.        Results: As measured by the frequency of metaphases not containing lethal aberrations, the survival curve for iron ions was exponential, whereas that for gamma rays was decidedly curvilinear. We observed an apparent slight curvature in the dose response for total chromosome exchange breakpoints following exposure to Fe-56 ions, but a curvilinear model did not receive overwhelming statistical support. More importantly, support for the curvilinear model decreased when only cells containing transmissible (nonlethal) aberrations were considered. This is in stark contrast to the results for low LET Cs-137 photons, where curvilinearity in the dose response had overwhelming support irrespective of whether total or only nonlethal aberrations were considered.        Conclusions: We make the assumption that high atomic number, high-energy (HZE) iron ions mimic the biological effects of the high-dose/high-LET (Bragg-peak) region of ions used in hadron therapy. To the extent this is true our results suggest that fractionation would not change the biological response for cell killing within the target volume. We further assume that the biological effects of gamma photons are principally equivalent to those of the low-dose/low-LET entrance (plateau) region of the dE/dx profile. In that case, fractionation is expected to elicit considerable sparing for the low-LET/low-dose entrance region occupied by normal tissues. Consequently, while hypo-fractionation would provide no additional benefit insofar as tumor cell killing is concerned, it may well increase the risk of normal tissue damage. Since most secondary solid tumors are thought to be formed near the treatment margin of the high-LET/highdose region, neither will fractionation have an effect on the induction of cells containing only nonlethal aberrations. Consequently, the incidence of second cancers is unlikely to be unaffected by any type of fractionation schedule. Thus, from a purely cytogenetic perspective, we conclude that hypo- fractionated hadron radiotherapy is a precarious proposition to be considered with due caution.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods and focuses on cytogenetic effects of radiation without discussing applications of AI in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The methods involve irradiating human lymphocytes with Cs-137 gamma rays or Fe-56 ions and assessing chromosome aberrations using mFISH. The results discuss survival curves for iron ions versus gamma rays, curvature in dose responses, and implications for fractionation effects on normal tissue damage and second cancer risks. The conclusion suggests that hypo-fractionation might not benefit tumor cell killing but could increase normal tissue damage risk. They also mention that the incidence of second cancers isn't affected by fractionation schedules. Now, looking at the topic again: it's about AI applications in carbon ion therapy. This abstract doesn't mention anything about AI methods or techniques. It's purely a cytogenetic study comparing different types of radiation and their effects on chromosomes without any reference to machine learning, algorithms, data analysis tools, or any other AI-related aspects.

rayyan-1273750896,Clinical oxygen enhancement ratio of tumors in carbon ion radiotherapy: the influence of local oxygenation changes,"The effect of carbon ion radiotherapy on hypoxic tumors has recently been questioned because of low linear energy transfer (LET) values in the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hypoxia and local oxygenation changes (LOCs) in fractionated carbon ion radiotherapy. Three-dimensional tumors with hypoxic subvolumes were simulated assuming interfraction LOCs. Different fractionations were applied using a clinically relevant treatment plan with a known LET distribution. The surviving fraction was calculated, taking oxygen tension, dose and LET into account, using the repairable-conditionally repairable (RCR) damage model with parameters for human salivary gland tumor cells. The clinical oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) was defined as the ratio of doses required for a tumor control probability of 50% for hypoxic and well-oxygenated tumors. The resulting OER was well above unity for all fractionations. For the hypoxic tumor, the tumor control probability was considerably higher if LOCs were assumed, rather than static oxygenation. The beneficial effect of LOCs increased with the number of fractions. However, for very low fraction doses, the improvement related to LOCs did not compensate for the increase in total dose required for tumor control. In conclusion, our results suggest that hypoxia can influence the outcome of carbon ion radiotherapy because of the non-negligible oxygen effect at the low LETs in the SOBP. However, if LOCs occur, a relatively high level of tumor control probability is achievable with a large range of fractionation schedules for tumors with hypoxic subvolumes, but both hyperfractionation and hypofractionation should be pursued with caution.",0,,The study does not involve any AI methods; it focuses on biological simulations using a damage model without AI techniques.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article falls under the topic of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBION ION THERAPY'.

However, the ability to calculate the LETd in commercially available treatment planning systems (TPS) is lacking. PurposeThis study aims to develop a method of calculating the LETd of CIRT plans that could be robustly carried out in RayStation (V10B, Raysearch, Sweden). MethodsThe calculation used the fragment spectra in RayStation for the CIRT treatment planning. The dose-weighted averaging procedure was supported by the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM). The MKM-based pencil beam dose engine (PBA, v4.2) for calculating RBE-weighted doses was reformulated to become a LET-weighted calculating engine. A separate module was then configured to inversely calculate the LETd from the absorbed dose of a plan and the associated fragment spectra. In this study, the ion and energy-specific LET table in the LETd module was further matched with the values decoded from the baseline data of the Syngo TPS (V13C, Siemens, Germany). The LETd distributions of several monoenergetic and modulated beams were calculated and validated against the values derived from the Syngo TPS and the published data. ResultsThe differences in LETds of the monoenergetic beams between the new method and the traditional method were within 3% in the entrance and Bragg-peak regions. However, a larger difference was observed in the distal region. The results of the modulated beams were in good agreement with the works from the published literature. ConclusionsThe method presented herein reformulates the MKM dose engine in the RayStation TPS to inversely calculate LETds.

Material and Methods: Three sublines of a syngeneic rat prostate tumor (R3327) differing in grading (highly (-H) moderately (-HI) or anaplastic (-AT1)) were irradiated with increasing single doses of either C-12-ions or 6 MV photons in Copenhagen rats. Primary endpoint was local tumor control within 300 days. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-12-ions was calculated from the dose at 50% tumor control probability (TCD50) of photons and C-12-ions and was correlated with histological, physiological and genetic tumor parameters.        Results: Experimental findings demonstrated that (i) TCD50-values between the three tumor sublines differed less for C-12-ions (23.6-32.9 Gy) than for photons (38.2-75.7 Gy), (ii) the slope of the dose response curve for each tumor line was steeper for C-12-ions than for photons, and (iii) the RBE increased with tumor grading from 1.62 +/- 0.11 (H) to 2.08 +/- 0.13 (HI) to 2.30 +/- 0.08 (AT1).        Conclusion: The response to C-12-ions is less dependent on resistance factors as well as on heterogeneity between and within tumor sublines as compared to photons. A clear correlation between decreasing differentiation status and increasing RBE was found. C-12-ions may therefore be a therapeutic option especially in patients with undifferentiated prostate tumors, expressing high resistance against photons. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

rayyan-1273750900,Time-resolved MRI for off-line treatment robustness evaluation in carbon-ion radiotherapy of pancreatic cancer,"Purpose In this study, we investigate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the clinical evaluation of gating treatment robustness in carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) of pancreatic cancer. Indeed, MRI allows radiation-free repeated scans and fast dynamic sequences for time-resolved (TR) imaging (cine-MRI), providing information on inter- and intra-fraction cycle-to-cycle variations of respiratory motion. MRI can therefore support treatment planning and verification, overcoming the limitations of the current clinical standard, that is, four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), which describes an ""average"" breathing cycle neglecting breathing motion variability. Methods We integrated a technique to generate a virtual CT (vCT) from 3D MRI with a method for 3D reconstruction from 2D cine-MRI, to produce TR vCTs for dose recalculations. For eight patients, the method allowed evaluating inter-fraction variations at end-exhale and intra-fraction cycle-to-cycle variability within the gating window in terms of tumor displacement and dose to the target and organs at risk. Results The median inter-fraction tumor motion was in the range 3.33-12.16 mm, but the target coverage was robust (-0.4% median D-95% variation). Concerning cycle-to-cycle variations, the gating technique was effective in limiting tumor displacement (1.35 mm median gating motion) and corresponding dose variations (-3.9% median D-95% variation). The larger exposure of organs at risk (duodenum and stomach) was caused by inter-fraction motion, whereas intra-fraction cycle-to-cycle dose variations were limited. Conclusions This study proposed a method for the generation of TR vCTs from MRI, which enabled an off-line evaluation of gating treatment robustness and suggested its feasibility to support treatment planning of pancreatic tumors in CIRT.",0,,The study does not explore any AI methods but focuses on MRI-based techniques for treatment evaluation.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

In targeted drug delivery, it is necessary to deliver a right amount of drug to the right place for reducing the side effects, which requires a deep understanding of the behavior of inhaled particles in the human respiratory system. The purpose of present study is to evaluate the potential of ellipsoidal particles for targeting drug delivery in a realistic model of tracheobronchial airway extends from oral cavity to the fourth generation. Ellipsoidal particles with fixed minor axis of 3.6 mu m and different aspect ratio in the range of 1 to 10 are injected to the airway model at steady state flow rate using the discrete phase model in Fluent software. This simulation includes drag and gravity force acting on ellipsoidal particles. The deposition patterns of ellipsoidal particles are compared to spherical particles. The results showed that flow rate has a direct effect on particle transport and consequently on deposition pattern of both ellipsoidal and spherical particles, and most of the deposition occurs in the mouth-throat. In addition, the deposition of ellipsoidal particles in the mouth-throat region reduced as the aspect ratio increased. In conclusion, ellipsoidal particles showed more flexibility for targeting drug delivery compared to spherical particles.",0,,The article focuses on particle behavior simulation for drug delivery and does not involve any AI methods related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract again carefully to understand what it's about. The title mentions evaluating ellipsoidal particles for inhalation therapy compared to spherical ones. The content talks about dry powder inhalers, drug delivery in the respiratory system, and using simulations with Fluent software to model particle behavior. They looked at how different aspect ratios of ellipsoidal particles affect their deposition patterns in the airway model. The conclusion suggests that ellipsoidal particles might be better for targeted drug delivery because they can reduce mouth-throat deposition as the aspect ratio increases. Now, I need to see if this relates to AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation treatment used in cancer care. It uses charged particles, specifically carbon ions, which are more effective at destroying cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Applications of AI in this context could involve things like optimizing treatment plans, predicting outcomes, enhancing image analysis for targeting, or improving the precision of the therapy delivery. The article I'm looking at doesn't mention anything about AI methods. It's purely a simulation study using computational fluid dynamics to model particle behavior in the respiratory system. There's no discussion of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, or any other AI techniques being applied here.

In recent years, evidence accumulated that CIRT improves the therapeutic outcome in patients with otherwise poor response to immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we aimed at identifying the underlying mechanisms of CIRT-induced tumor immunogenicity and treatment efficacy. We used human U2OS osteosarcoma cells for the in vitro assessment of immunogenic cell death and established several in vivo models of melanoma in mice. We treated the animals with conventional radiation, CIRT, PD-1-targeting immune checkpoint blockade or a sequential combinations of radiotherapy with checkpoint blockade. We utilized flow cytometry, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblot analysis, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to assess biomarkers of immunogenic cell death in vitro. Treatment efficacy was studied by tumor growth assessment and the tumor immune infiltrate was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Compared with conventional radioimmunotherapy, the combination of CIRT with anti-PD-1 more efficiently triggered traits of immunogenic cell death including the exposure of calreticulin, the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the exodus of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as well as the induction of type-1 interferon responses. In addition, CIRT plus anti-PD-1 led to an increased infiltration of CD4(+), and CD8(+) lymphocytes into the tumor bed, significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival of melanoma bearing mice.

rayyan-1273750905,Comparing Oncologic Outcomes and Toxicity for Combined Modality Therapy vs. Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy for Previously Irradiated Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer,"Simple SummaryThe efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) alone vs. multimodality therapy, including surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and intraoperative radiotherapy for previously irradiated locally recurrent rectal cancer, has not been evaluated. A total of 85 patients receiving 70.4 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions of CIRT were compared with 86 patients receiving 30 Gy in 15 fractions of chemoradiation, resection, and intraoperative electron radiotherapy. CIRT demonstrated improved two- and five-year overall survival (83.1% and 46.8% vs. 62.5% and 25.7% for CMT), with statistically equivalent local recurrence and disease progression, with reduced treatment toxicity and decreased patient cost. A prospective comparison is warranted.No standard treatment paradigm exists for previously irradiated locally recurrent rectal cancer (PILRRC). Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) may improve oncologic outcomes and reduce toxicity compared with combined modality therapy (CMT). Eighty-five patients treated at Institution A with CIRT alone (70.4 Gy/16 fx) and eighty-six at Institution B with CMT (30 Gy/15 fx chemoradiation, resection, intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT)) between 2006 and 2019 were retrospectively compared. Overall survival (OS), pelvic re-recurrence (PR), distant metastasis (DM), or any disease progression (DP) were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier model, with outcomes compared using the Cox proportional hazards model. Acute and late toxicities were compared, as was the 2-year cost. The median time to follow-up or death was 6.5 years. Median OS in the CIRT and CMT cohorts were 4.5 and 2.6 years, respectively (p <= 0.01). No difference was seen in the cumulative incidence of PR (p = 0.17), DM (p = 0.39), or DP (p = 0.19). Lower acute grade >= 2 skin and GI/GU toxicity and lower late grade >= 2 GU toxicities were associated with CIRT. Higher 2-year cumulative costs were associated with CMT. Oncologic outcomes were similar for patients treated with CIRT or CMT, although patient morbidity and cost were lower with CIRT, and CIRT was associated with longer OS. Prospective comparative studies are needed.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods applied to carbon-ion therapy; it focuses on clinical outcomes comparison between CIRT and other therapies.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273750906,Evaluation of therapeutic gain for fractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy using the tumor growth delay and crypt survival assays,"Background and purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic gain of carbon ion (C-ion) radiotherapy using a mouse model.        Materials and methods: Transplanted fibrosarcoma (NFSa) growing in C3H/He mice and murine small intestine were irradiated with 290 MeV/nucleon C-ion beams (C-ions) in 1-12 fractions separated by 4 h. The cell killing efficiencies of C-ions were measured using jejunum crypt survival and tumor growth delay (TGD) assays.        Results: The equieffect dose for crypt survival and TGD increased with increasing number of fractions after X-rays and 20 keV/mu m C-ions, whereas TGD after 77 keV/mu m C-ions rather decreased. Crypts showed stronger LET-dependent increase in a terms than the tumor while beta terms less depended on LET irrespective of tissues. Therapeutic gain factor, i.e., a ratio of tumor RBE over crypt RBE, of 77 keV/mu m C-ions was more than unity at any doses while that of 20 keV/mu m C-ions increased with an increase in dose per fraction.        Conclusions: These specific data imply that use of large dose per fraction would be suitable for C-ion radiotherapy irrespective of LET from the point of view of therapeutic gain, though small dose per fraction by high-LET radiation decreases total dose for tumor.

rayyan-1273750908,Kill-painting of hypoxic tumours in charged particle therapy,"Solid tumours often present regions with severe oxygen deprivation (hypoxia), which are resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Increased radiosensitivity as a function of the oxygen concentration is well described for X-rays. It has also been demonstrated that radioresistance in anoxia is reduced using high-LET radiation rather than conventional X-rays. However, the dependence of the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) on radiation quality in the regions of intermediate oxygen concentrations, those normally found in tumours, had never been measured and biophysical models were based on extrapolations. Here we present a complete survival dataset of mammalian cells exposed to different ions in oxygen concentration ranging from normoxia (21%) to anoxia (0%). The data were used to generate a model of the dependence of the OER on oxygen concentration and particle energy. The model was implemented in the ion beam treatment planning system to prescribe uniform cell killing across volumes with heterogeneous radiosensitivity. The adaptive treatment plans have been validated in two different accelerator facilities, using a biological phantom where cells can be irradiated simultaneously at three different oxygen concentrations. We thus realized a hypoxia-adapted treatment plan, which will be used for painting by voxel of hypoxic tumours visualized by functional imaging.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions 'Kill-painting of hypoxic tumours in charged particle therapy', which sounds related to cancer treatment, specifically using charged particles like carbon ions. That's a good start because carbon ion therapy is part of the topic. Now, looking at the content: they talk about hypoxia in tumors and how it affects radiotherapy. They mention using different ions and creating a model based on oxygen concentration and particle energy. The model was implemented into a treatment planning system to ensure uniform cell killing across varying radiosensitivities. They validated this with experiments in accelerators, using biological phantoms where cells were irradiated at different oxygen levels. So the key points here are: developing a model for treatment planning, implementing it into a system, and validating its effectiveness. Now, does this involve AI? The abstract doesn't explicitly mention any AI methods like machine learning, neural networks, or algorithms typically associated with AI. Instead, they're talking about biophysical models based on data collected from experiments. They generated a model of OER dependence, which is more of a physics-based model rather than an AI-driven one. So while the article discusses applications in charged particle therapy and treatment planning, it doesn't seem to incorporate AI methods. Therefore, it might not fall under the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. However, I should double-check if any part implies AI usage indirectly. The model was used in a treatment planning system, but without mentioning AI techniques, it's hard to say they're applying AI here. So my conclusion is that this article doesn't fit the topic because it lacks explicit AI methods."
rayyan-1273750910,Clinical dose assessment for scanned carbon-ion radiotherapy using linear energy transfer measurements and Monte Carlo simulations,"Objective. Dosimetric commissioning of treatment planning systems (TPS) focuses on validating the agreement of the physical dose with experimental data. For carbon-ion radiotherapy, the commissioning of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is necessary to predict the clinical outcome based on the radiation quality of the mixed radiation field. In this study, we proposed a approach for RBE commissioning using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which was further strengthen by RBE validation based on linear energy transfer (LET) measurements. Approach. First, we tuned the MC simulation based on the results of dosimetric experiments including the beam ranges, beam sizes, and MU calibrations. Furthermore, we compared simulated results to measured depth- and radial-LET distributions of the 430 MeV u(-1) carbon-ion spot beam with a 1.5 mm(2), 36 mu m thick silicon detector. The measured dose-averaged LET (LETd) and RBE were compared with the simulated results. The RBE was calculated based on the mixed beam model with linear-quadratic parameters depending on the LET. Finally, TPS-calculated clinical dose profiles were validated through the tuned MC-based calculations. Main results. A 10 keV mu m(-1) and 0.15 agreement for LETd and RBE, respectively, were found between simulation and measurement results obtained for a 2 sigma lateral size of 430 MeV u(-1) carbon-ion spot beam in water. These results suggested that the tuned MC simulation can be used with acceptable precision for the RBE and LET calculations of carbon-ion spot beam within the clinical energy range. For physical and clinical doses, the TPS- and MC-based calculations showed good agreements within 1.0% at the centre of the spread-out Bragg peaks. Significance. The tuned MC simulation can accurately reproduce the actual carbon-ion beams, and it can be used to validate the physical and clinical dose distributions calculated by TPS. Moreover, the MC simulation can be used for dosimetric commissioning, including clinical doses, without LET measurements.",0,,The article does not explore any AI methods; it focuses on Monte Carlo simulations and LET measurements for RBE commissioning in carbon-ion radiotherapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750913,"Reformulation of a clinical-dose system for carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan","At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), more than 8,000 patients have been treated for various tumors with carbon-ion (C-ion) radiotherapy in the past 20 years based on a radiobiologically defined clinicaldose system. Through clinical experience, including extensive dose escalation studies, optimum dose-fractionation protocols have been established for respective tumors, which may be considered as the standards in C-ion radiotherapy. Although the therapeutic appropriateness of the clinicaldose system has been widely demonstrated by clinical results, the system incorporates several oversimplifications such as dose-independent relative biological effectiveness (RBE), empirical nuclear fragmentation model, and use of dose-averaged linear energy transfer to represent the spectrum of particles. We took the opportunity to update the clinical-dose system at the time we started clinical treatment with pencil beam scanning, a new beam delivery method, in 2011. The requirements for the updated system were to correct the oversimplifications made in the original system, while harmonizing with the original system to maintain the established dose-fractionation protocols. In the updated system, the radiation quality of the therapeutic C-ion beam was derived with Monte Carlo simulations, and its biological effectiveness was predicted with a theoretical model. We selected the most used C-ion beam with alpha(r) = 0.764 Gy(-1) and beta = 0.0615 Gy(-2) as reference radiation for RBE. The C-equivalent biological dose distribution is designed to allow the prescribed survival of tumor cells of the human salivary gland (HSG) in entire spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) region, with consideration to the dose dependence of the RBE. This C-equivalent biological dose distribution is scaled to a clinical dose distribution to harmonize with our clinical experiences with C-ion radiotherapy. Treatment plans were made with the original and the updated clinical-dose systems, and both physical and clinical dose distributions were compared with regard to the prescribed dose level, beam energy, and SOBP width. Both systems provided uniform clinical dose distributions within the targets consistent with the prescriptions. The mean physical doses delivered to targets by the updated system agreed with the doses by the original system within +/- 1.5% for all tested conditions. The updated system reflects the physical and biological characteristics of the therapeutic C-ion beam more accurately than the original system, while at the same time allowing the continued use of the dose-fractionation protocols established with the original system at NIRS.",0,,"The abstract does not mention any AI methods; it focuses on updating a clinical-dose system using Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical models, which are not AI techniques.","Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

However, it remains unclear whether LET affects late complications. We assessed whether physical dose and LET distribution can be specific factors for late rectal complications in C-ion RT.        Materials and methods: Overall, 134 patients with uterine carcinomas were registered and retrospectively analysed. Of 134 patients, 132 who were followed up for >6 months were enrolled. The correlations between the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose based on the Kanai model (the ostensible ""clinical dose""), dose-averaged LET (LETd), or physical dose and rectal complications were evaluated. Rectal complications were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria.        Results: Nine patients developed grade 3 or 4 late rectal complications. Linear regression analysis found that D-2cc in clinical dose was the sole risk factor for >= grade 3 late rectal complications (p = 0.012). The receiver operating characteristic analysis found that D-2cc of 60.2 Gy (RBE) was a suitable cut-off value for predicting >= grade 3 late rectal complications. Among 35 patients whose rectal D-2cc was >= 60.2 Gy (RBE), no correlations were found between severe rectal toxicities and LETd alone or physical dose per se.        Conclusion: We demonstrated that severe rectal toxicities were related to the rectal D-2cc of the clinical dose in C-ion RT. However, no correlations were found between severe rectal toxicities and LETd alone or physical dose per se. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Active motion management techniques were employed, and several measures were applied to mitigate the interplay effect induced by a moving target. CIRT was planned with the LEM-I-based treatment planning system and delivered by raster scanning. Offline PET/CT imaging was used to verify the beam range. Offline adaptive replanning was performed whenever required. Twenty-three patients with a median tumor size of 4.3 cm (range, 1.7-8.5 cm) were enrolled in the present study.

rayyan-1273750916,Model of Intraperitoneal Targeted α-Particle Therapy Shows That Posttherapy Cold-Antibody Boost Enhances Microtumor Radiation Dose and Treatable Tumor Sizes,"Intraperitoneally administered radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been tested in several clinical trials, often with promising results, but have never proven curative. Methods: We have previously presented simulations of clinically relevant amounts of intraperitoneal Y-90-mAbs for treatment of minimal disease and shown that such treatments are unlikely to eradicate microtumors. Our previous model simulated the kinetics of intraperitoneally infused radiolabeled mAbs in humans and showed the benefit of instead using alpha-emitters such as At-211. In the current work, we introduce penetration of mAbs into microtumors with radii of up to 400 mu m. Calculations were performed using dynamic simulation software. To determine the radiation dose distribution in nonvascularized microtumors of various sizes after intraperitoneal At-211-radioimmunotherapy, we used an in-house-developed Monte Carlo program for microdosimetry. Our aim was to find methods that optimize the therapy for as wide a tumor size range as possible. Results: Our results show that high-specific-activity radiolabeled mAbs that are bound to a tumor surface will penetrate slowly compared with the half-lives of At-211 and shorter-lived radionuclides. The inner-core cells of tumors with radii exceeding 100 mu m may therefore not be sufficiently irradiated. For lower specific activities, the penetration rate and dose distribution will be more favorable for such tumors, but the dose to smaller microtumors and single cells will be low. Conclusion: Our calculations show that the addition of a boost with unlabeled mAb 1-5 h after therapy results in sufficient absorbed doses both to single cells and throughout microtumors up to approximately 300 mu m in radius. This finding should also hold for other high-affinity mAbs and short-lived alpha-emitters.",0,,The article discusses alpha-particle therapy using simulations and Monte Carlo methods but does not involve AI in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article falls under the topic of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273750917,"Effective particle energies for stopping power calculation in radiotherapy treatment planning with protons and helium, carbon, and oxygen ions","The stopping power ratio (SPR) of body tissues relative to water depends on the particle energy. For simplicity, however, most analytical dose planning systems do not account for SPR variation with particle energy along the beam's path, but rather assume a constant energy for SPR estimation. The range error due to this simplification could be indispensable depending on the particle species and the assumed energy. This error can be minimized by assuming a suitable energy referred to as an 'effective energy' in SPR estimation. To date, however, the effective energy has never been investigated for realistic patient geometries. We investigated the effective energies for proton, helium-, carbon-, and oxygen-ion radiotherapy using volumetric models of the reference male and female phantoms provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The range errors were estimated by comparing the particle ranges calculated when particle energy variations were and were not considered.

Methods: Local effect model I was established in RayStation (Ray-LEM) with the same parameters as in LEM I in Syngo (Syngo-LEM). Three cube plans covering most of the tumors treated at our center were generated with Syngo-LEM. Ray-LEM re-calculated the Syngo plans and compared the RBEs to the Syngo counterparts. The results showed that RayStation RBE was smaller than Syngo RBE. To ensure that Ray-LEM reproduced Syngo RBE, the observed deviations were used to scale the maximum RBE (RBEmax) in Ray-LEM. After this calibration, we further compared the RayStation RBE to Syngo RBE using additional plans in both homogeneous phantoms and patients, to ensure that the calibrated Ray-LEM reproduced Syngo RBE even with more complex planning features. Results: The calibration increased the RBEmax by 2.3% to raise the Ray-LEM RBE. The target mean RBE deviations in the phantom evaluation plans were median: 0.0 (minimum: - 1.1 to maximum: 0.7) %, and the target mean RBE deviations of the clinical target volumes of 16 patient cases were - 0.4 (- 1.5 to 0.2) %.

To assess the dosimetric consequences and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the organs at risk (OARs) in intensity-modulated particle radiotherapy of proton (IMPT) and carbon-ion (IMCT) using a fixed-beam delivery system when compared with intensity-modulated photon radiotherapy (IMRT) for locally advanced small-cell lung cancer. Approach. The plans were all designed under the same total relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted prescription dose, in which the planning target volume (PTV) of the internal gross target volume(IGTV) and the PTV of the clinical target volume was irradiated with 69.3 Gy (RBE) and 63 Gy (RBE), respectively, using a simultaneously integrated boosting (SIB) technique. NTCPs were estimated for heart, lung, esophagus and spinal cord by Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) and logistic models. Dose escalation was simulated under the desired NTCP values (0.05, 0.10 and 0.50) of the three radiation techniques. Main results. Under the similar target coverage, almost all OARs were significantly better spared (p < 0.05) when using the particle radiotherapy except for D1cc (the dose to 1 cm(3) of the volume) of the proximal bronchial tree (p > 0.05).

rayyan-1273750921,Carbon ion radiotherapy of human lung cancer attenuates HIF-1 signaling and acts with considerably enhanced therapeutic efficiency,"Carbon ion irradiation is an emerging therapeutic option for various tumor entities. Radiation resistance of solid tumors toward photon irradiation is caused by attenuation of DNA damage in less oxygenated tumor areas and by increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling. Carbon ion irradiation acts independently of oxygen; however, the role of HIF-1 is unclear. We analyzed the effect of HIF-1 signaling after carbon ions in comparison to photons by using biological equivalent radiation doses in a human non-small-cell cancer model. The studies were performed in cultured A549 and H1299 cell lines and in A549 xenografts. Knockdown of HIF-1 in vivo combined with photon irradiation delayed tumor growth (23 vs. 13 d; P<0.05). Photon irradiation induced HIF-1 and target genes, predominantly in oxygenated cells (1.6-fold; P<0.05), with subsequent enhanced tumor angiogenesis (1.7-fold; P<0.05). These effects were not observed after carbon ion irradiation. Micro-DNA array analysis indicated that photons, but not carbon ions, significantly induced components of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (gene set enrichment analysis; P<0.01) as relevant for HIF-1 induction. After carbon ion irradiation in vivo, we observed substantially decreased HIF-1 levels (8.9-fold; P<0.01) and drastically delayed tumor growth (P<0.01), an important finding that indicates a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than anticipated from the cell survival data. Taken together, the evidence showed that carbon ions mediate an improved therapeutic effectiveness without tumor-promoting HIF-1 signaling.Subtil, F. S.

Neoepitopes represent a viable option to induce antitumor immune responses, but they have limitations, such as low immunogenicity and tolerance induction. Parvovirus B19 virus-like particles may be used to deliver neoepitopes to prime cellular immunity. We designed and evaluated the therapeutic effect of VP2 B19-virus-like particles, with multi-neoepitopes, in a 4T1 breast cancer model. Balb/c mice received four therapeutic immunizations with multi-neoepitopes-virus-like, wild type-virus-like, vehicle, or virus-like plus Cry1Ac adjuvant particles, intraperitoneally and peritumorally. Tumor growth, lung macro-metastasis, and specific immune responses were evaluated. Therapeutic administration of multi-epitopes virus-like particles significantly delayed tumor growth and decreased the lung macrometastasis number, in comparison to treatment with wild type-virus-like particles, which surprisingly also elicited antitumoral effects that were improved with the adjuvant. Only treatments with multiepitope virus-like particles induced specific proliferative responses of CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes and Granzyme-B production in lymphatic nodes local to the tumor. Treatment with recombinant multiple neoepitopes-virus-like particles induced specific cellular responses, inhibited tumor growth and macro-metastasis, thus B19-virus-like particles may function as an effective delivery system for neoepitopes for personalized immunotherapy.

rayyan-1273750923,Treatment planning of carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer based on cellular experiments with PC3 human prostate cancer cells,"[Purpose] Treatment plans for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in Japan are designed to uniformly deliver the prescribed clinical dose based on the radiosensitivity of human salivary gland (HSG) cells to the planning target volume (PTV). However, sensitivity to carbon beams varies between cell lines, that is, it should be checked that the clinical dose distribution based on the cell radiosensitivity of the treatment site is uniform within the PTV.[Methods] We modeled the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of the linear-quadratic (LQ) coefficients specific to prostate cancer, which accounts for the majority of CIRT. This was achieved by irradiating prostate cancer cells (PC3) with X-rays from a 4 MV-Linac and carbon beams with different LETs of 11.1-214.3 keV/mu m. By using the radiosensitivity of PC3 cells derived from cellular experiments, we reconstructed prostate-cancer -specific clinical dose distributions on patient computed tomography (CT).[Results] The LQ coefficient, alpha, of PC3 cells was larger than that of HSG cells at low (<50 keV/mu m) LET and smaller at high (>50 keV/mu m) LET, which was validated by cellular experiments performed on rectangular SOBPs. The reconstructed dose distribution on patient CT was sloped when 1 fraction incident from the one side of the patient was considered, but remained uniform from the sum of 12 fractions of the left-right opposing beams (as is used in clinical practice).[Conclusion] Our study reveals the inhomogeneity of clinical doses in single-field plans calculated using the PC3 radiosensitivity data. However, this inhomogeneity is compensated by using the combination of left-right opposing beams.",0,,The study focuses on cellular experiments and treatment planning without incorporating any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic, which is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. The abstract provided is about treatment planning for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) using cellular experiments with PC3 cells. Let me break it down step by step to understand if it falls within the scope of AI applications in CIRT. First, the purpose mentions that treatment plans are designed based on the radiosensitivity of HSG cells, but they're checking this against PC3 cells because sensitivity varies between cell lines. The methods involve modeling the LET dependence of LQ coefficients specific to prostate cancer using X-rays and carbon beams with different LETs. They also reconstructed dose distributions on patient CT scans. The results show differences in alpha values between PC3 and HSG cells at various LET levels, and how the dose distribution changes based on single-field vs opposing beams. The conclusion points out that while single-field plans have inhomogeneous doses when using PC3 data, combining left-right opposing beams compensates for this. Now, looking for AI methods: the abstract doesn't mention any machine learning, algorithms, or computational models beyond basic modeling of LQ coefficients and dose reconstruction. It's more about experimental validation of treatment planning based on cellular responses rather than applying AI techniques. Since there's no indication of AI being used in the research, it doesn't fall under the topic of applications of AI in CIRT. Therefore, I should select '0' for this article."

Methods The records of 262 patients with low-risk prostate cancer (median age, 65 [47-80] years) treated with C-ion RT at QST Hospital, National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology in Japan during 2000-2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Four different protocol outcomes and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses were evaluated. The median follow-up was 8.4 years. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the biochemical or clinical failure-free rate (BCFFR). Clinical RBE was calculated using the tumor control probability model. Results The 5-, 7-, and 10-year BCFFRs were 91.7%, 83.8%, and 73.2%, respectively. The 10-year BCFFRs of patients who received C-ion RT at 66 Gy (RBE) in 20 fractions, 63 Gy (RBE) in 20 fractions, and 57.6 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions were 81.4%, 70.9%, and 68.9%, respectively. The PSA level and density during follow-up were better in the patients treated with the lower fraction size. A higher PSA nadir and shorter time to PSA nadir were risk factors for biochemical or clinical failure by multivariate Cox regression. The tumor control probability analysis showed that the estimated clinical RBE values to achieve an 80% BCFFR at 10 years for 20, 16, and 12 fractions were 2.19 (2.18-2.24), 2.16 (2.14-2.23), and 2.12 (2.09-2.21), respectively.

In a cohort of 237 patients, among other factors, we found that an Aspartate transaminase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) value of > 0.40 was a particularly strong independent predictor of worse overall survival, progression-free survival and hepatic progression-free survival outcomes. Background: Transarterial radioembolisation (TARE) with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres is a treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the liver (mCRC). A better understanding of the prognostic factors and treat-ment application can improve survival outcomes. Methods: We analysed the safety and effectiveness of 237 mCRC patients included in the prospective observational study CIRSE Registry for SIR-Spheres Therapy (CIRT) for indepen-dent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and hepatic progression-free survival (hPFS) using the Cox proportional-hazard model. Results: The median OS was 9.8 months, median PFS was 3.4 months and median hPFS was 4.2 months. Independent prognostic factors for an improved overall survival were the absence of extra-hepatic disease ( P = .0391), prior locoregional procedures ( P = .0037), an Aspartate transaminase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) value of <= 0.40 ( P < .0001) and Inter national Nor malized Ratio (INR) <= 1 ( P = .0078). Partition model dosimetry resulted in improved OS outcomes compared to the body surface area model ( P = .0120). Independent predictors for PFS were APRI > 0.40 ( P = .0416) and prior ablation ( P = .0323), and for hPFS these were 2 to 5 tumor nodules ( P = .0148), Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 3 ( P = .0075) and APRI > 0.40 ( P = .0207). During the study, 95 of 237 (40.1%) patients experienced 197 adverse events, with 28 of 237 (11.8%) patients having a grade 3 or higher adverse events.

Two examples which have recently attracted significant attention are magnetic particle imaging (MPI) for biological monitoring, and magnetic field hyperthermia (MFH) for cancer therapy. Here for the first time, the capability of a Lissajous scanning MPI device to act as a standalone platform to support the application of MFH cancer treatment is presented. The platform is shown to offer functionalities for nanoparticle localization, focused hyperthermia therapy application, and non-invasive tissue thermometry in one device. Combined, these capabilities have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy, effectiveness and safety of MFH therapy. Measurements of nanoparticle hyperthermia during protracted exposure to the MPI scanner's 3D imaging field sequence revealed spatially focused heating, with a maximum that is significantly enhanced compared with a simple 1-dimensional sinusoidal excitation. The observed spatial heating behavior is qualitatively described based on a phenomenological model considering torques exerted in the Brownian regime.In vitrocell studies using a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) demonstrated strong suppression of both structural integrity and metabolic activity within 24 h following a 40 min MFH treatment actuated within the Lissajous MPI scanner. Furthermore, reconstructed MPI images of the nanoparticles distributed among the cells, and the temperature-sensitivity of the MPI imaging signal obtained during treatment are demonstrated.

So it's talking about using magnetic particles in medical applications, specifically for imaging and hyperthermia therapy. Magnetic hyperthermia is a method where magnetic nanoparticles are used to generate heat inside the body, typically to treat cancer by heating the tumor cells. The article describes how they've integrated this with an MPI device, which stands for magnetic particle imaging. They mention that this platform can do multiple things: localize nanoparticles, apply focused hyperthermia therapy, and measure tissue temperature non-invasively. All of these are done in one device, which is pretty cool because it could make treatments more accurate and safer. The abstract also talks about experiments they did with cells, showing that the treatment was effective in suppressing cell activity within 24 hours after a 40-minute session. They also provide images and temperature data from the treatment. Now, looking at the topic again: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is another type of cancer treatment, using ions instead of traditional radiation. It's known for being more precise and causing less damage to surrounding tissues.

Surgical intervention to remove the spacers is sometimes necessary because of abdominal infections triggered by long-term spacer placement or intestinal perforation. Therefore, spacers that do not require surgical removal and provide effective drainage against abdominal infections are urgently needed. This study aimed to develop a spacer that could be removed non-surgically and one that provides the therapeutic effect of drainage in patients who receive carbon ion radiotherapy for abdominal tumors. A novel fan-shaped spacer was constructed from a film drain that was folded along the trigger line. Simple withdrawal of the trigger line caused the film drain to fold and the holding lines to become free. We performed laparoscopy-assisted insertion with pneumoperitoneum and blind removal of the spacer fourteen times using a porcine model. Saline in the abdominal cavity was effectively aspirated using the spacer.

We developed a TAT for metastatic uveal melanoma, targeting the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is expressed in 94% of uveal melanomas. Two versions of the therapy are being investigated: Ac-225-DOTA-Ahx-MC1RL (Ac-226-Ahx) and Ac-225-DOTA-di-D-Glu-MCIRL (Ac-226-di-n-Glu). The biodistribution (BD) from each was studied and a multi-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed to describe drug distribution rates. Two groups of 16 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing high MC1R expressing tumors were intravenously injected with Ac-225-Ahx or Ac-225-di-D-Glu. After injection, four groups (n = 4) were euthanized at 24, 96, 144, and 288 h time points for each cohort. Tumors and 13 other organs were harvested at each time point. Isomeric gamma spectra were measured in tissue samples using a scintillation gamma detector and converted to a activity using factors for gamma ray abundance per a decay. Time activity curves were calculated for each organ. A five-compartment PK model was built with the following compartments: blood, tumor, normal tissue, kidney, and liver. This model is characterized by a system of five ordinary differential equations using mass action kinetics, which describe uptake, intercompartmental transitions, and clearance rates. The ordinary differential equations were simultaneously solved and fit to experimental data using a genetic algorithm for optimization. The BD data show that both compounds have minimal distribution to organs at risk other than the kidney and liver. The PK parameter estimates had less than 5% error. From these data, Ac-225-Ahx showed larger and faster uptake in the liver. Both compounds had comparable uptake and clearance rates for other compartments. The BD and PK behavior for two targeted radiopharmaceuticals were investigated.

Simplified proton and carbon treatment plans were simulated in a water phantom to investigate the optimization feasibility. Track structures of the mixed radiation field produced at different depths in the target volume were simulated with Geant4-DNA and nanodosimetric descriptors were calculated. The fluences of the treatment field pencil beams were optimized in order to create a mixed field with equal nanodosimetric descriptors at each of the multiple positions in spread-out particle Bragg peaks. For both proton and carbon ion plans, a uniform spatial distribution of nanodosimetric descriptors could be obtained by optimizing opposing-field but not single-field plans. The results obtained indicate that uniform nanodosimetrically weighted plans, which may also be radiobiologically uniform, can be obtained with this approach.

The range simulated via Geant4 and SRIM software shows an agreement of similar to 99%. The PFXS simulation has been conducted using three models of Geant4: the Binary Cascade (BIC), Liege Intranuclear cascade (INCL++), and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD). The PFXS is computed for heavy (Z = 5-9) and light (Z = 2-4) fragments. These models have been validated by analysing simulation data with experimental and semi-empirical nuclear fragmentation model data.

Methods: We performed a retrospective propensity score matching analysis (1:1) of patients treated with IMRT and IMRT + CIRT. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the baseline characteristics of the patients. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent predictors of survival. We examined the association between risk factors and adverse events (AEs) using chi-square tests. Cox model and logistic regression were used to analyze AEs. Results: Hundred and nine patients who received IMRT + CIRT were included and the median follow-up time was 20.6 months (range: 4.6-82 months). There were no statistically significant differences in locoregional failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival, or overall survival between the two groups, but potentially better in IMRT + CIRT group (p > 0.05, respectively). Nodal boost was the only significant factor associated with LRFS and DFS on multivariable analysis. Thirty-seven patients (34.0%) developed grade 3 acute OMs and no grade 4 acute OMs were observed in IMRT + CIRT group. All patients in IMRT + CIRT group developed grade 1 dermatitis; while in the match group, 76 patients developed grade 1 dermatitis, 27 patients developed grade 2 dermatitis, 5 patients developed grade 3 dermatitis, 1 patient developed grade 4 dermatitis. IMRT + CIRT treatment was associated with a significant trend of lower grades of OM and dermatitis (p < 0.05, respectively). Any severe (i.e., grade 3) chronic AEs, such as xerostomia, skin fibrosis, temporal lobe necrosis, osteoradionecrosis, or radiation-induced optic neuropathy, was not observed. Conclusions: In this study, IMRT + CIRT was associated with significantly reduced acute toxicity burden compared with full course of IMRT, with excellent survival outcomes. Patients with persistent disease after treatment and treated with nodal boost had a worse outcome.

LDL-P by NMR has been shown to be a better measure of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL-C, and may therefore be a better gauge of the need for and response to statin treatment. Using the Model, we conducted a virtual clinical trial comparing the use of LDL-C alone, LDL-P alone, and LDL-C and LDL-P together to guide treatment in the general adult population, and in high-risk, dyslipidemic subpopulations. In the general population, the 5-year major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) relative risk reduction (RRR) of LDL-P alone compared to the control arm (LDL-C alone) was 5.0% (95% CI, 4.7-5.3; p < .0001); using both LDL-C and LDL-P (dual markers) led to 3.0% RRR compared to the control arm (95% CI, 2.8-3.3; p < .0001). For individuals with diabetes, the RRR was 7.3% (95% CI, 6.4-8.2; p <.0001) for LDL-P alone and 6.9% for dual markers (95% CI, 6.1-7.8; both, p < .0001).        In the general population, the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with the use of LDL-P alone were $76,052 at 5 years and $8913 at 20 years and $142,825 at 5 years and $25,505 at 20 years with the use of both markers. In high-risk subpopulations, the use of LDL-P alone was cost-saving at 5 years; whereas the cost per QALY for the use of both markers was $14,250 at 5 years and $859 at 20 years for high-risk dyslipidemics, $19,192 at 5 years and $ 649 at 20 years for diabetics, and $9030 at 5 years and $7268 at 20 years for patients with prior CHD. In conclusion, the model estimates that using LDL-P to guide statin therapy may reduce the risk of CVD events to a greater extent than does the use of LDL-C alone and maybe cost-effective or cost-saving for high-risk patients.

Outcomes with radiotherapy are poor. Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is being explored as an alternative when surgery is not preferred.        OBJECTIVE To compare oncologic outcomes and treatment-related toxicity of CIRT and en bloc resection for sacral chordoma.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Univariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between treatment type and oncologic and toxicity outcomes in this retrospective cohort study. Nearest-neighbor propensity score matching was used to match the CIRT cohort with the en bloc resection cohort and 10 National Cancer Database (NCDB) cohorts separately, with the objective of obtaining more homogeneous cohorts when comparing treatments. Patient- and tumor-related characteristics from 2 institutional cohorts were collected for patients diagnosed with sacral chordomas between April 1, 1994, and July 31, 2017. The NCDB was queried for data on patients with sacral chordoma from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2016, as a comparator in overall survival (OS) analyses. Data analysis was conducted from February 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021.        EXPOSURES En bloc resection, incomplete resection, photon radiotherapy, proton radiotherapy, and CIRT.        MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Cox proportional hazards model. Peripheral motor nerve toxic effects were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.        RESULTS A total of 911 patients were included in the study (NCDB: n = 669; median age, 64 [IQR, 52-74] years; 410 [61.3%] men; CIRT: n = 188; median age, 66 [IQR, 58-71] years; 128 [68.1%] men; en bloc surgical resection: n = 54; median age, 53.5 [IQR 49-64] years, 36 [66.7%] men). Comparison of the propensity score-matched institutional en bloc resection and CIRT cohorts revealed no statistically significant difference in OS (CIRT: median OS, 68.1 [95% CI, 44.0-102.6] months; en bloc resection: median OS, 58.6 [95% CI, 25.6-123.5] months; P = .57; hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.25-2.06]; P = .53). The CIRT cohort experienced lower rates of peripheral motor neuropathy (odds ratio, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.04-0.40]; P < .001). On comparison of the propensity score-matched NCDB cohorts with the CIRT cohort, significantly higher OS was found for CIRT compared with margin-positive surgery without adjuvant radiotherapy (CIRT: median OS, 64.7 [95% CI, 57.8-69.7] months; margin-positive surgery without adjuvant radiotherapy: median OS, 60.6 [95% CI, 44.2-69.7] months, P = .03) and primary radiotherapy alone (CIRT: median OS, 64.9 [95% CI 57.0-70.5] months; primary radiotherapy alone: 31.8 [95% CI, 27.9-40.6] months; P < .001).

Methods In all, 40 HCCs were divided into group A (tumors located > 1 cm away from gastrointestinal [GI] tract), and group B (tumors located < 1 cm away from GI tract). The prescribed curative doses were 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) in 10 fractions for group A, and 67.5 Gy (RBE) in 15 fractions for group B. IMRT, PRT and CIRT plans were separately generated to reach the curative doses and coverage. Dosimetric parameters evaluated were mean dose to normal liver (MDTNL) and the volume of normal liver receiving more than 1 Gy (RBE) (V1). Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model was used to determine the incidences of classic RILD, and Power model of non-linear regression, to estimate the tumor volume that could be irradiated with the curative doses within dose constraint of MDTNL.        Results With comparable target doses, the MDTNL (Gy [RBE]) were 18.8 +/- 3.7, 13.5 +/- 3.1 and 12.8 +/- 2.7 in group A and 24.9 +/- 7.1, 18.2 +/- 3.7 and 17.5 +/- 3.7 in group B, respectively, for IMRT, PRT and CIRT.

rayyan-1273750946,Virtual particle Monte Carlo: A new concept to avoid simulating secondary particles in proton therapy dose calculation,"Background In proton therapy dose calculation, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are superior in accuracy but more time consuming, compared to analytical calculations. Graphic processing units (GPUs) are effective in accelerating MC simulations but may suffer thread divergence and racing condition in GPU threads that degrades the computing performance due to the generation of secondary particles during nuclear reactions. Purpose A novel concept of virtual particle (VP) MC (VPMC) is proposed to avoid simulating secondary particles in GPU-accelerated proton MC dose calculation and take full advantage of the computing power of GPU. Methods Neutrons and gamma rays were ignored as escaping from the human body; doses of electrons, heavy ions, and nuclear fragments were locally deposited; the tracks of deuterons were converted into tracks of protons. These particles, together with primary and secondary protons, are considered to be the realistic particles. Histories of primary and secondary protons were replaced by histories of multiple VPs. Each VP corresponded to one proton (either primary or secondary). A continuous-slowing-down-approximation model, an ionization model, and a large angle scattering event model corresponding to nuclear interactions were developed for VPs by generating probability distribution functions (PDFs) based on simulation results of realistic particles using MCsquare. For efficient calculations, these PDFs were stored in the Compute Unified Device Architecture textures. VPMC was benchmarked with TOPAS and MCsquare in phantoms and with MCsquare in 13 representative patient geometries. Comparisons between the VPMC calculated dose and dose measured in water during patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) of the selected 13 patients were also carried out. Gamma analysis was used to compare the doses derived from different methods and calculation efficiencies were also compared. Results Integrated depth dose and lateral dose profiles in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms all matched well among VPMC, TOPAS, and MCsquare calculations. The 3D-3D gamma passing rates with a criterion of 2%/2 mm and a threshold of 10% was 98.49% between MCsquare and TOPAS and 98.31% between VPMC and TOPAS in homogeneous phantoms, and 99.18% between MCsquare and TOPAS and 98.49% between VPMC and TOPAS in inhomogeneous phantoms, respectively. In patient geometries, the 3D-3D gamma passing rates with 2%/2 mm/10% between dose distributions from VPMC and MCsquare were 98.56 +/- 1.09% in patient geometries. The 2D-3D gamma analysis with 3%/2 mm/10% between the VPMC calculated dose distributions and the 2D measured planar dose distributions during PSQA was 98.91 +/- 0.88%. VPMC calculation was highly efficient and took 2.84 +/- 2.44 s to finish for the selected 13 patients running on four NVIDIA Ampere GPUs in patient geometries.

rayyan-1273750947,Precise on-line position measurement for particle therapy,"An on-line beam position monitoring and regular beam stability tests are of utmost importance for the Quality Assurance (QA) of the patient treatment at any particle therapy facility. The Gantry 2 at the Paul Scherrer Institute uses a strip ionization chamber for the on-line beam position verification. The design of the strip chamber placed in the beam in front of the patient allows for a small beam penumbra in order to achieve a high-quality lateral beam delivery. The position error of 1 mm in a lateral plane (plane perpendicular to the beam direction) can result in a dose inhomogeneity of more than 5%. Therefore the goal of Gantry 2 commissioning was to reach a sub-millimeter level of the reconstruction accuracy in order to bring a dose uncertainty to a level of 1%. In fact, we observed that for beams offered by Gantry 2 signal profiles in a lateral plane can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.1 mm. This is a necessary criterion to perform a reliable patient treatment.

As the beam lines are fixed in the vertical and horizontal directions at our facility, beam delivery is interrupted in multi-field treatment due to the necessity of patient repositioning within the fields. Single-fractionated treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is such a case, in which four treatment fields in multiple directions are delivered in one session with patient repositioning during the session. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the period of dose delivery, including interruptions due to patient repositioning, on tumor control probability (TCP) of NSCLC. All clinical doses were weighted by relative biological effectiveness (RBE) evaluated for instantaneous irradiation. The rate equations defined in the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) for primary lesions induced in DNA were applied to the single-fractionated treatment of NSCLC. Treatment plans were made for an NSCLC case for various prescribed doses ranging from 25 to 50 Gy (RBE), on the assumption of instantaneous beam delivery. These plans were recalculated by varying the interruption time tau ranging from 0 to 120 min between the second and third fields for continuous irradiations of 3 min per field based on the MKM. The curative doses that would result in a TCP of 90% were deduced for the respective interruption times. The curative dose was 34.5 Gy (RBE) for instantaneous irradiation and 36.6 Gy (RBE), 39.2 Gy (RBE), 41.2 Gy (RBE), 43.3 Gy (RBE) and 44.4 Gy (RBE) for tau = 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min and 120 min, respectively. The realistic biological effectiveness of therapeutic carbon-ion beam decreased with increasing interruption time. These data suggest that the curative dose can increase by 20% or more compared to the planned dose if the interruption time extends to 30 min or longer. These effects should be considered in carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning if a longer dose-delivery procedure time is anticipated.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods; it focuses on beam interruption effects using a microdosimetric kinetic model.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article falls under the topic of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

However, relapses in the bone marrow are common. [At-211]meta-astatobenzylguanidine ([At-211] MABG) is an alpha particle emitter with higher biological effective-ness and short path length which effectively sterilizes microscopic residual disease. Here we investigated the safety and antitumor activity [At-211]MABG in preclinical models of neuroblastoma. Experimental Design: We defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), biodistribution, and toxicity of [At-211]MABG in immuno-deficient mice in comparison with [I-131]MIBG. We compared the antitumor efficacy of [At-211]MABG with [I-131]MIBG in three murine xenograft models. Finally, we explored the efficacy of [At-211]MABG after tail vein xenografting designed to model disseminated neuroblastoma. Results: The MTD of [At-211]MABG was 66.7 MBq/kg (1.8 mCi/kg) in CB17SC scid(-/-) mice and 51.8 MBq/kg (1.4 mCi/kg)in NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rgt(m1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mice. Biodistribution of [At-211]MABG was similar to [I-131]MIBG. Long-term toxicity studies on mice administered with doses up to 41.5 MBq/ kg (1.12 mCi/kg) showed the radiotherapeutic to be well tolerated. Both 66.7 MBq/kg (1.8 mCi/kg) single dose and fractionated dosing 16.6 MBq/kg/fraction (0.45 mCi/kg) x 4 over 11 days induced marked tumor regression in two of the three models studied. Survival was significantly prolonged for mice treated with 12.9 MBq/kg/fraction (0.35 mCi/kg) x 4 doses over 11 days [At-211]MABG in the disseminated disease (IMR-05(NET/GFP/LUC)) model (P = 0.003) suggesting eradication of microscopic disease. Conclusions: [At-211]MABG has significant survival ad-vantage in disseminated models of neuroblastoma.

rayyan-1273750955,Factors impacting survival after transarterial radioembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Results from the prospective CIRT study,"Background & Aims: Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres is an established treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, optimising treatment application and patient selection remains challenging. We report here on the effectiveness, safety and prognostic factors, including dosing methods, associated with TARE for HCC in the prospective observational CIRT study. Methods: We analysed 422 patients with HCC enrolled between Jan 2015 and Dec 2017, with follow-up visits every 3 months for up to 24 months after first TARE. Patient characteristics and treatment-related data were collected at baseline; adverse events and time-to-event data (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS] and hepatic PFS) were collected at every 3-month follow-up visit. We used the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model and propensity score matching to identify independent prognostic factors for effectiveness outcomes. Results: The median OS was 16.5 months, the median PFS was 6.1 months, and the median hepatic PFS was 6.7 months. Partition model dosimetry resulted in improved OS compared to body surface area calculations on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.46-0.92; p = 0.0144), which was confirmed in the exact matching propensity score analysis (hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.89; p = 0.0136). Other independent prognostic factors for OS were ECOG-performance status >0 (p = 0.0018), presence of ascites (p = 0.0152), right-sided tumours (p = 0.0002), the presence of portal vein thrombosis (p = 0.0378) and main portal vein thrombosis (p = 0.0028), ALBI grade 2 (p = 0.0043) and 3 (p = 0.0014). Adverse events were recorded in 36.7% of patients, with 9.7% of patients experiencing grade 3 or higher adverse events. Conclusions: This large prospective observational dataset shows that TARE is an effective and safe treatment in patients with HCC. Using partition model dosimetry was associated with a significant improvement in survival outcomes. Impact and implications: Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a form of localised radiation therapy and is a potential treatment option for primary liver cancer. We observed how TARE was used in real-life clinical practice in various European countries and if any factors predict how well the treatment performs. We found that when a more complex but personalised method to calculate the applied radiation activity was used, the patient responded better than when a more generic method was used. Furthermore, we identified that general patient health, ascites and liver function can predict outcomes after TARE. Clinical trial number: NCT02305459. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Let me start by understanding what each part means. The article is about a study on transarterial radioembolization (TARE) using Yttrium-90 resin microspheres for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They looked at factors affecting survival, including dosing methods and other patient characteristics. The study involved 422 patients over several years with follow-ups every three months. They used statistical models like Cox proportional hazard and propensity score matching to identify prognostic factors. One key finding was that partition model dosimetry improved overall survival compared to body surface area calculations. Other factors included ECOG performance status, ascites presence, tumor location, portal vein thrombosis, and ALBI grade. Adverse events were also recorded. The conclusion emphasizes the effectiveness of TARE and how personalized dosing methods can enhance outcomes. Now, looking at the topic: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of photons or protons. It's known for its precision in targeting tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Applications of AI here could involve treatment planning, dose optimization, patient selection, outcome prediction, etc. The article in question doesn't mention anything about AI methods. It talks about dosimetry techniques but specifically refers to partition model and body surface area calculations, which are more traditional statistical or mathematical models rather than AI. There's no discussion of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, predictive models using AI, or any other AI-related technologies.

rayyan-1273750956,A scintillator-based range telescope for particle therapy,"The commissioning and operation of a particle therapy centre requires an extensive set of detectors for measuring various parameters of the treatment beam. Among the key devices are detectors for beam range quality assurance. In this work, a novel range telescope based on a plastic scintillator and read out by a large-scale CMOS sensor is presented. The detector is made of a stack of 49 plastic scintillator sheets with a thickness of 2-3 mm and an active area of 100 x 100 mm(2), resulting in a total physical stack thickness of 124.2 mm. This compact design avoids optical artefacts that are common in other scintillation detectors. The range of a proton beam is reconstructed using a novel Bragg curve model that incorporates scintillator quenching effects. Measurements to characterise the performance of the detector were carried out at the Heidelberger Ionenstrahl-Therapiezentrum (HIT, Heidelberg, GER) and the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre (CCC, Bebington, UK). The maximum difference between the measured range and the reference range was found to be 0.41 mm at a proton beam range of 310 mm and was dominated by detector alignment uncertainties. With the new detector prototype, the water-equivalent thickness of PMMA degrader blocks has been reconstructed within +/- 0.1 mm. An evaluation of the radiation hardness proves that the range reconstruction algorithm is robust following the deposition of 6,300 Gy peak dose into the detector. Furthermore, small variations in the beam spot size and transverse beam position are shown to have a negligible effect on the range reconstruction accuracy. The potential for range measurements of ion beams is also investigated.",0,,The article focuses on a novel scintillator-based range telescope for particle therapy but does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Yet, the premature release of PpIX is one of the most abundant dilemma encounters the therapeutic outcomes of PDT due to associated toxicity and redistribution to serum proteins. In this study, ultrastable tetraether lipids (TELs) based liposomes were developed. PpIX molecules were identified to reside physically in the monolayer; thereby the inherent - stacking that leads to aggregation of PpIX in aqueous milieu was dramatically improved. TEL29.9mol% and TEL62mol% based liposomes revealed PpIX sustained release diffusion pattern from spherical particles as confirmed by converged fitting to Baker & Lonsdale model. Stability in presence of human serum albumins, a key element for PDT accomplishment was emphasized. The epitome candidates were selected for vascular photodynamic (vPDT) in in-Ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane. Profoundly, TEL62mol% based liposomes proved to be the most effective liposomes that demonstrated localized effect within the irradiated area without eliciting quiescent vasculatures damages.

rayyan-1273750959,Impact of beamline-specific particle energy spectra on clinical plans in carbon ion beam therapy,"Purpose The Local Effect Model version one (LEM I) is applied clinically across Europe to quantify the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon ion beams. It requires the full particle fluence spectrum differential in energy in each voxel as input parameter. Treatment planning systems (TPSs) use beamline-specific look-up tables generated with Monte Carlo (MC) codes. In this study, the changes in RBE weighted dose were quantified using different levels of details in the simulation or different MC codes. Methods The particle fluence differential in energy was simulated with FLUKA and Geant4 at 500 depths in water in 1-mm steps for 58 initial carbon ion energies (between 120.0 and 402.8 MeV/u). A dedicated beam model was applied, including the full description of the Nozzle using GATE-RTionV1.0 (Geant4.10.03p03). In addition, two tables generated with FLUKA were compared. The starting points of the FLUKA simulations were phase space (PhS) files from, firstly, the Geant4 nozzle simulations, and secondly, a clinical beam model where an analytic approach was used to mimic the beamline. Treatment plans (TPs) were generated with RayStation 8B (RaySearch Laboratories AB, Sweden) for cubic targets in water and 10 clinical patient cases using the clinical beam model. Subsequently, the RBE weighted dose was re-computed using the two other fluence tables (FLUKA PhS or Geant4). Results The fluence spectra of the primary and secondary particles simulated with Geant4 and FLUKA generally agreed well for the primary particles. Differences were mainly observed for the secondary particles. Interchanging the two energy spectra (FLUKA vs. GEANT4) to calculate the RBE weighted dose distributions resulted in average deviations of less than 1% in the entrance up to the end of the target region, with a maximum local deviation at the distal edge of the target. In the fragment tail, larger discrepancies of up to 5% on average were found for deep-seated targets. The patient and water phantom cases demonstrated similar results. Conclusion RBE weighted doses agreed well within all tested setups, confirming the clinical beam model provided by the TPS vendor. Furthermore, the results showed that the open source and generally available MC code Geant4 (in particular using GATE or GATE-RTion) can also be used to generate basic beam data required for RBE calculation in carbon ion therapy.",0,[],The article focuses on Monte Carlo simulations and beamline-specific particle energy spectra but does not explore any AI methods in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

rayyan-1273750960,Bilirubin-Coated Radioluminescent Particles for Radiation-Induced Photodynamic Therapy,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown potential as a cancer treatment modality, but its clinical application is limited due to its visible-light activation since visible wavelengths of light cannot penetrate tissues well. Additionally, combination therapies utilizing PDT and radiotherapy have shown clinical promise in several cancers but are limited again by light penetration and the need for selective photosensitization of the treatment area. Herein, we report the development of bilirubin-photodynamic nanoparticles (PEGylated bilirubin-encapsulated CaWO4 nanoparticles or ""PEG-BR/CWO NPs""). PEG-BR/CWO NPs are a formulation of PEGylated bilirubin micelles encapsulating CaWO4 nanoparticles. These particles are capable of activating PDT via X-ray irradiation within deep tissues due to the radioluminescence properties of their CaWO4 nanoparticle cores. PEG-BR/CWO NPs facilitate a combination of photodynamic and radiation therapy and represent a previously unexplored application of PEG-bilirubin conjugates as photosensitizing agents. When irradiated by X-rays, PEG-BR/CWO NPs emit UV-A and visible light from their CaWO4 cores, which excites bilirubin and leads to the production of singlet oxygen. PEG-BR/CWO NPs exhibit improvements over X-ray therapy alone in vitro and in murine xenograft models of head and neck cancer.

rayyan-1273750961,Impact of Gaussian uncertainty assumptions on probabilistic optimization in particle therapy,"Range and setup uncertainties in charged particle therapy may induce a discrepancy between the planned and the delivered dose. Countermeasures based on probabilistic (stochastic) optimization usually assume a Gaussian probability density to model the underlying range and setup error. While this standard assumption is generally taken for granted, this study explicitly investigates the dosimetric consequences if the actual range and setup errors obey a different probability density function (PDF) over the course of treatment to the one used during the probabilistic treatment plan optimization. Discrete random sampling was performed for conventionally and probabilistically optimized proton and carbon ion treatment plans utilizing various PDFs that modeled the setup and range error. This method allowed us to assess the treatment plan robustness against different PDFs of conventional and probabilistic plans, which both explicitly assume Gaussian uncertainties. The induced uncertainty in dose was quantified by estimating the expectation value and standard deviation of the RBE-weighted dose for each PDF on the basis of 2500-5000 random dose samples. Probabilistic dose metrics and standard deviation volume histograms were computed to quantify treatment plan robustness of both optimization approaches. It was shown that the classical planning target volume margin extension concept did not compensate the influence of range and setup errors and consequently resulted in a non-negligible average standard deviation in dose of 7.3% throughout the clinical target volume (CTV). In contrast, probabilistic optimization on normally distributed errors yielded treatment plans that not only entailed a lower standard deviation against normally distributed errors accounted for during optimization, but also lower standard deviations for other symmetric PDFs. It was shown that the impact of an incorrect probability distribution assumption is of lower importance after probabilistic optimization as the average uncertainty in the CTV drops to 3.9%. Probabilistic optimization is an effective tool to create robust particle treatment plans. Normally distributed range and setup error assumptions for probabilistic optimization are a reasonable first approximation and yield treatment plans that are also robust against other PDFs.",0,,The study focuses on probabilistic optimization and uncertainty modeling but does not involve any AI methods in the context of carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

However, optimising the timing of TARE in relation to systemic therapies and patient selection remains challenging. We report here on the effectiveness, safety, and prognostic factors associated with TARE for ICC in a combined analysis of the prospective observational CIRT studies (NCT02305459 and NCT03256994). Methods A combined analysis of 174 unresectable ICC patients enrolled between 2015 and 2020 was performed. Patient characteristics and treatment-related data were collected at baseline; adverse events and time-to-event data (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS] and hepatic PFS) were collected at every follow-up visit. Log-rank tests and a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model were used to identify prognostic factors. Results Patients receiving a first-line strategy of TARE in addition to any systemic treatment had a median OS and PFS of 32.5 months and 11.3 months. Patients selected for first-line TARE alone showed a median OS and PFS of 16.2 months and 7.4 months, whereas TARE as 2nd or further treatment-line resulted in a median OS and PFS of 12 and 9.3 months (p = 0.0028), and 5.1 and 3.5 months (p = 0.0012), respectively. Partition model dosimetry was an independent predictor for better OS (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.37-0.94], p = 0.0259). No extrahepatic disease, no ascites, and < 6.1 months from diagnosis to treatment were independent predictors for longer PFS.

rayyan-1273750963,Knowledge Translation in Challenging Healthcare Environments: The PIOPPO Experience at the National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO Foundation),"Knowledge translation is the ability to translate concepts and ideas effectively among different stakeholders, leading to innovation and new knowledge. Translating knowledge is particularly challenging in the healthcare sector, which has been experiencing a shift from a centralized and sequential model of value creation to a more distributed and open model, where various stakeholders (including patients) act as co-creators of the outcome. According to management as well as the medical literature, knowledge translation in healthcare has been mainly seen as the translation of scientific research into clinical practice. However, different types of knowledge translation emerge, such as when multidisciplinary teams need to work together on a joint medical project. In this situation, multiple backgrounds, competencies, skills, and emotional feelings of the different stakeholders are a compelling barrier that prevents the effective transfer and sharing of knowledge. This is why knowledge translation needs a set of enablers to facilitate the transfer, sharing, and creation of new knowledge, innovation, and ideas. This paper investigates such a perspective by analyzing the PIOPPO project from the National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO Foundation) in Pavia, Italy. The CNAO is one of the few dual-beam Hadrontherapy centres in the world that provides a beam that is able to irradiate patients with protons or carbon ions to treat radioresistant tumours. The PIOPPO project is an experimental phase 2 trial involving preoperative chemotherapy and carbon ion therapy to treat resectable and borderline-resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

One of these tasks is the quantification and consideration of the Bragg peak (BP) degradation due to lung tissue: as lung is an heterogeneous tissue, the BP is broadened when particles traverse the microscopic alveoli. These are not fully resolved in clinical CT images and thus, the effect is not considered in the dose calculation. In this work, a correlation between the CT histograms of heterogeneous material and the impact on the BP curve is presented. Different inorganic materials were scanned with a conventional CT scanner and additionally, the BP degradation was measured in a proton beam and was then quantified. A model is proposed that allows an estimation of the modulation power by performing a histogram analysis on the CT scan. To validate the model for organic samples, a second measurement series was performed with frozen porcine lunge samples. This allows to investigate the possible limits of the proposed model in a set-up closer to clinical conditions. For lung substitutes, the agreement between model and measurement is within +/- 0.05 mm and for the organic lung samples, within +/- 0.15 mm. This work presents a novel, simple and efficient method to estimate if and how much a material or a distinct region (within the lung) is degrading the BP on the basis of a common clinical CT image. Up until now, only a direct in-beam measurement of the region or material of interest could answer this question.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their application to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

In particular, secondary prompt gamma detection is a promising tool to monitor the dose delivery. The present research evaluates the capability of a HEXITEC detector to identify the prompt gammas produced during proton beam therapy, and assesses its potential for online range verification.

The current study examined the risk factors of the local recurrence of sarcomas after carbon ion radiotherapy. Methods Patients with inoperable bone and soft-tissue sarcomas treated with carbon ion radiotherapy in our institute from 2010 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 87 patients were eligible for this study. We divided the instances of local recurrence into two types, in-field and out-field recurrence, and evaluated the predictors for the risk of local recurrence such as the age at the treatment, sex, histopathological diagnosis, standard uptake value on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and the clinical target volume for each recurrence using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results A multivariate analysis revealed that the tumors with a post-treatment standard uptake value of more than 3.84 on positron emission tomography had a significantly high risk of in-field recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.42; p = .03). Furthermore, postoperative lesions were a risk factor for out-field recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.82; p < .01).

rayyan-1273750968,FRED: a fast Monte Carlo code on GPU for quality control in Particle Therapy,"Charged Particle Therapy is a non-invasive technique for radio-resistant tumor treatment performed with protons or light ions, aiming to deliver a high precision treatment. Compared to conventional radiotherapy, ions allow for a higher dose deposition in the tumor region while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. To really exploit the potential benefits of this technique, the highest possible accuracy in the calculation of dose and its spatial distribution is required in treatment planning. Commonly used Treatment Planning Software solutions adopt a simplified beam{body interaction model. An alternative is the use of Monte Carlo simulations which explicitly take into account the interaction of charged particles with actual human tissues hence providing highly accurate results. However, Monte Carlo simulations are used in a restricted number of cases due to substantial computational resources required. The code FRED has been developed to allow a fast optimization of the treatment plans in Charged Particle Therapy while profiting from the dose release accuracy of a Monte Carlo tool. Currently, the most refined module is the transport of proton beams in water. A comparison with measurements shows that the lateral dose tails are reproduced within 2% in the field size factor test up to 20 cm. Models for the interaction of ion with the matter are currently under development in the FRED code.

These dot particles interacted with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gram-negative bacteria, which enabled PMB-mediated docking to the outer membrane of gram-negative cells.

rayyan-1273750970,Targeted Alpha Particle Therapy Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment and Improves Efficacy of Immunotherapy,"Purpose: The tumor microenvironment (TME) can severely impair immunotherapy efficacy by repressing the immune system. In a multiple myeloma (MM) murine model, we investigated the impact of targeted alpha particle therapy (TAT) on the immune TME. TAT was combined with an adoptive cell transfer of CD8 T cells (ACT), and the mechanisms of action of this combination were assessed at the tumor site.        Methods and Materials: This combination treatment was conducted in a syngeneic MM murine model grafted subcutaneously. TAT was delivered by intravenous injection of a bismuth-213 radiolabeled anti-CD138 antibody. To strengthen antitumor immune response, TAT was combined with an ACT of tumor-specific CD8+ OT-1 T-cells. The tumors were collected and the immune TME analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo T-cell motility assay on tumor slices. The chemokine and cytokine productions were also assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.        Results: Tumor-specific CD8+ OT-1 T cells infiltrated the tumors after ACT. However, only treatment with TAT resulted in regulatory CD4 T-cell drop and transient increased production of interleukin-2, CCL-5, and interferon-g within the tumor. Moreover, OT-1 T-cell recruitment and motility were increased on tumor slices from TAT-treated mice, as observed via ex vivo time lapse, contributing to a more homogeneous distribution of OT-1 T cells in the tumor. Subsequently, the tumor cells increased PD-L1 expression, antitumor cytokine production decreased, and OT-1 T-cells overexpressed exhaustion markers, suggesting an exhaustion of the immune response.        Conclusion: Combining TAT and ACT seems to transiently remodel the cold TME, improving ACT efficiency. The immune response then leads to the establishment of other tumor cell resistance mechanisms.

rayyan-1273750971,Modulation power of porous materials and usage as ripple filter in particle therapy,"Porous materials with microscopic structures like foam, sponges, lung tissues and lung substitute materials have particular characteristics, which differ from those of solid materials. Ion beams passing through porous materials show much stronger energy straggling than expected for non-porous solid materials of the same thickness. This effect depends on the microscopic fine structure, the density and the thickness of the porous material. The beam-modulating effect from a porous plate enlarges the Bragg peak, yielding similar benefits in irradiation time reduction as a ripple filter. A porous plate can additionally function as a range shifter, which since a higher energy can be selected for the same penetration depth in the body reduces the scattering at the beam line and therefore improves the lateral fall-off. Bragg curve measurements of ion beams passing through different porous materials have been performed in order to determine the beam modulation effect of each. A mathematical model describing the correlation between the mean material density, the porous pore structure size and the strength of the modulation has been developed and a new material parameter called 'modulation power' is defined as the square of the Gaussian sigma divided by the mean water-equivalent thickness of the porous absorber. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed in order to validate the model and to investigate the Bragg peak enlargement, the scattering effects of porosity and the lateral beam width at the end of the beam range. The porosity is found to only influence the lateral scattering in a negligible way. As an example of a practical application, it is found that a 20 mm and 50 mm plate of Gammex LN300 performs similar to a 3 mm and 6 mm ripple filter, respectively, and at the same time can improve the sharpness of the lateral beam due to its multifunctionality as a ripple filter and a range shifter.",0,,The article discusses physical properties and effects of porous materials in particle therapy but does not mention any AI methods or their applications.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Two by two combinations of these chemicals are made to investigate the possible benefit when two radiosensitizers are present. A model is proposed to understand the results of the presence of two modifying agents on the dose effects. Materials and methods: The cells were incubated for 6 h in the presence of the following molecules: dichloro terpyridine platinum, concentration C = 350 mu M, betamethasone and deoxyglucose with concentrations of C = 0.2 mu M and C = 6 mM, respectively. The cells were subsequently irradiated by carbon C6+ ion 290 MeV/amu up to a dose of 2.5 Gy, under atmospheric conditions. Results: The presence of the platinum salt or bethamethasone augments the cell death rate. The combination of betamethasone with the platinum salt also increases the cell death rate, but less than for the platinum salt alone.

Delivery efficiency is the bottleneck of spot-scanning proton arc therapy (SPArc) because of the numerous energy layers (ELs) ascending switches. This study aims to develop a new algorithm to mitigate the need for EL ascending via water equivalent thickness (WET) sector selection followed by particle swarm optimization (SPArc-(particle swarm)). Approach. SPArc-(particle swarm) divided the full arc trajectory into the optimal sectors based on K-means clustering analysis of the relative mean WET. Within the sector, particle swarm optimization was used to minimize the total energy switch time, optimizing the energy selection integrated with the EL delivery sequence and relationship. This novel planning framework was implemented on the open-source platform matRad (Department of Medical Physics in Radiation Oncology, German Cancer Research Center-DKFZ).

Biofilms grown on WPs were challenged with rifampin and cefazolin (100 mu g/mL) to determine antibiotic efficacy.

Bone changes were monitored using microCT scanning. The presence of WPs decreased antibiotic efficacy against biofilm-resident bacteria and promoted MPO and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro.

The pristine dose Bragg curves in water for all ion beams and the LETd for proton beams were generated from Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The optimization algorithms were implemented using the Python programming language. High-accuracy optimization results of the spatial distribution of the desired physical quantity were then obtained for different cases. The relative difference between the real value and the expected value of a given quantity was approximately within +/- 1.0% in the whole target region. The optimization examples include a flat dose spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) for the three selected ions, an upslope dose SOBP for protons, and a downslope dose SOBP for protons. The relative difference was approximately within +/- 2.0% for the case with a flat LETd (target value = 4 keV/mu m) distribution for protons. These one-dimensional optimization algorithms can be extended to two or three dimensions if the corresponding physical data are available. In addition, this physical quantity optimization strategy can be conveniently extended to encompass biological dose optimization if appropriate biophysical models are invoked.",0,,The article focuses on physical parameter optimization for charged particle therapy but does not explicitly apply AI methods specific to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions a physical parameter optimization scheme for radiobiological studies of charged particle therapy, which includes carbon ions as one of the selected beams (C-12 ion). The content talks about optimizing the spatial distribution of physical quantities like dose or LETd using an algorithm implemented in Python. They used Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations and achieved high accuracy with relative differences around 1%. The examples include optimization for different types of SOBPs, including flat, upslope, and downslope, which are relevant to therapy planning. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention AI methods beyond using optimization algorithms implemented in Python. It's more about the physical optimization rather than applying specific AI techniques like machine learning or neural networks. So while it's related to charged particle therapy (including carbon ions), it might not directly fall under applications of AI unless we consider the optimization algorithms as AI, which is a bit of a stretch. Therefore, I'm leaning towards not selecting this article because it doesn't clearly demonstrate the application of AI methods in carbon ion therapy."

A simple model of large particle clusters (containing more than one hundred individual particles) is introduced. Dipolar interactions among clustered particles markedly modify shape and area of the hysteresis loops in a way critically dependent on particle size and cluster dimensions, thereby modulating the power released as heat to a host medium. For monodisperse and polydisperse systems, particle clustering can lead to either a significant enhancement or a definite reduction of the released power; in particular cases the same particles can produce opposite effects in dependence of the dimensions of the clusters. Modulation by clustering of the heating ability of magnetic nanoparticles has impact on applications requiring optimization and accurate control of temperature in the host medium, such as magnetic hyperthermia for precision therapy or fluid flow management, and advanced diagnostics involving magnetic tracers.",0,[],The article discusses magnetic nanoparticles for hyperthermia but does not mention AI or its applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The title mentions heating ability modulation by clustering of magnetic particles for precision therapy and diagnosis. The content talks about studying the magnetic and thermal properties of clustered magnetite nanoparticles using rate equations. They introduced a model for large clusters with more than one hundred individual particles. Dipolar interactions affect hysteresis loops, which in turn modulates the heat released. Depending on particle size and cluster dimensions, clustering can either enhance or reduce the power released. This has applications in magnetic hyperthermia for therapy and fluid flow management, as well as advanced diagnostics with magnetic tracers. Now, I need to see if this relates to AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of X-rays or protons. It's known for its precision in targeting tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. AI can play a role in optimizing treatment plans, improving image-guided delivery, and personalizing therapies based on patient data. The article here discusses magnetic nanoparticles used for heating in hyperthermia, which is another form of therapy but not specifically carbon ion therapy. It doesn't mention anything about AI methods or their applications in the context of carbon ions. Instead, it's focused on the physical properties of nanoparticles and their thermal effects.

However, these patients might differentially benefit from extrafine-particle inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This matched cohort, database study, compared the effectiveness of extrafine-particle with fine-particle ICS in a real-life population initiating ICS therapy in the Netherlands.        Methods: Data were from the Pharmo Database Network, comprising pharmacy and hospital discharge records, representative of 20 % of the Dutch population. The study population included patients aged 12 - 60, with a General Practice-recorded diagnosis for asthma (International Classification of Primary Care code R96), when available, >= 2 prescriptions for asthma therapy at any time in their recorded history, and receiving first prescription of ICS therapy as either extrafine-particle (ciclesonide or hydrofluoroalkane beclomethasone dipropionate [BDP]) or fine-particle ICS (fluticasone propionate or non-extrafine-particle-BDP). Patients were matched (1:1) on relevant demographic and clinical characteristics over 1-year baseline. Primary outcomes were severe exacerbation rates, risk domain asthma control and overall asthma control during the year following first ICS prescription. Secondary outcomes, treatment stability and being prescribed higher versus lower category of short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABA) dose, were compared over a 1-year outcome period using conditional logistic regression models.        Results: Following matching, 1399 patients were selected in each treatment cohort (median age: 43 years; males: 34 %). Median (interquartile range) initial ICS doses (fluticasone-equivalents in mu g) were 160 (160 - 320) for extrafine-particle versus 500 (250 - 500) for fine-particle ICS (p < 0.001). Following adjustment for residual confounders, matched patients prescribed extrafine-particle ICS had significantly lower rates of exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio [95 % CI], 0.59 [0.47-0.73]), and significantly higher odds of achieving asthma control and treatment stability in the year following initiation than those prescribed fine-particle ICS, and this occurred at lower prescribed doses. Patients prescribed extrafine-particle ICS had lower odds of being prescribed higher doses of SABA (0.50 [0.44-0.57]).        Conclusion: In this historical, matched study, extrafine-particle ICS was associated with better odds of asthma control than fine-particle ICS in patients prescribed their first ICS therapy in the Netherlands. Of importance, this was reached at significantly lower prescribed dose.",0,[],The study focuses on asthma treatment and does not involve any AI methods or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Here, a simple alkaline treatment method was employed for the complete removal of internal RNA from bacteria-and yeast-produced HBc VLPs and for the conversion of these VLPs into empty particles, without any damage to the VLP structure. The empty HBc VLPs were able to effectively package the added DNA and RNA sequences. Furthermore, the alkaline hydrolysis technology appeared efficient for the purification and packaging of four different HBc variants carrying lysine residues on the HBc VLP spikes.

These microparticles were prepared by electrospinning using gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD) conjugated with 3-(diethylamino)propylamine (DEAP, as a pH-responsive moiety), named gamma-CD-DEAP. The resulting microparticles had pore channels (constructed using gamma-CD-DEAP) extending into the deep compartment of the microparticles and allowing efficient paclitaxel (PTX, as a chemotherapeutic model drug) entrapment by a simple hole-filling encapsulation process. Importantly, the hydrophobic DEAP (at pH 7.4) in the gamma-CD-DEAP microparticles changed to hydrophilic DEAP (at pH 6.8) because of its acidic pH-induced protonation. This phenomenon resulted in an acidic pH-activated particle destruction by a charge-charge repulsion between the protonated DEAP moieties and allowed a pH-triggered release of the encapsulated PTX from the collapsed microparticles. Consequently, gamma-CD-DEAP microparticles implanted at the tumor site caused a significant enhancement of the in vitro/in vivo tumor cell ablation, suggesting their significant potential as a chemotherapeutic implant for tumor therapy.",0,[],The article focuses on pH-responsive microparticles for chemotherapy and does not involve AI methods or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273750988,Magnetic field effects on particle beams and their implications for dose calculation in MR-guided particle therapy,"Purpose: To investigate and model effects of magnetic fields on proton and carbon ion beams for dose calculation.        Methods: In a first step, Monte Carlo simulations using Gate 7.1/Geant4.10.0.p03 were performed for proton and carbon ion beams in magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 3 T. Initial particle energies ranged from 60 to 250 MeV (protons) and 120 to 400 MeV/u (carbon ions), respectively. The resulting dose distributions were analyzed focusing on beam deflection, dose deformation, as well as the impact of material heterogeneities. In a second step, a numerical algorithm was developed to calculate the lateral beam position. Using the Runge-Kutta method, an iterative solution of the relativistic Lorentz equation, corrected for the changing particle energy during penetration, was performed. For comparison, a gamma-index analysis was utilized, using a criteria of 2%/2 mm of the local maximum.        Results: A tilt in the dose distribution within the Bragg peak area was observed, leading to non-negligible dose distribution changes. The magnitude was found to depend on the magnetic field strength as well as on the initial beam energy. Comparison of the 3 T dose distribution with non-B field (nominal) dose distributions, resulted in a gamma(mean) (mean value of the gamma distribution) of 0.6, with 14.4% of the values above 1 and gamma(1)% (1% of all points have an equal or higher gamma value) of 1.8. The presented numerical algorithm calculated the lateral beam offset with maximum errors of less than 2% with calculation times of less than 5 mu s. The impact of tissue interfaces on the proton dose distributions was found to be less than 2% for a dose voxel size of 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3).        Conclusion: Non-negligible dose deformations at the Bragg peak area were identified for high initial energies and strong magnetic fields. A fast numerical algorithm based on the solution of the energy-corrected relativistic Lorentz equation was able to describe the beam path, taking into account the particle energy, magnetic field, and material.

rayyan-1273750989,Assessment of secondary neutrons in particle therapy by Monte Carlo simulations,"Objective. The purpose of this study is to estimate the energy and angular distribution of secondary neutrons inside a phantom in hadron therapy, which will support decisions on detector choice and experimental setup design for in-phantom secondary neutron measurements. Approach. Dedicated Monte Carlo simulations were implemented, considering clinically relevant energies of protons, helium and carbon ions. Since scored quantities can vary from different radiation transport models, the codes FLUKA, TOPAS and MCNP were used. The geometry of an active scanning beam delivery system for heavy ion treatment was implemented, and simulations of pristine and spread-out Bragg peaks were carried out. Previous studies, focused on specific ion types or single energies, are qualitatively in agreement with the obtained results. Main results. The secondary neutrons energy distributions present a continuous spectrum with two peaks, one centred on the thermal/epithermal region, and one on the high-energy region, with the most probable energy ranging from 19 up to 240 MeV, depending on the ion type and its initial energy. The simulations show that the secondary neutron energies may exceed 400 MeV and, therefore, suitable neutron detectors for this energy range shall be needed. Additionally, the angular distribution of the low energy neutrons is quite isotropic, whereas the fast/relativistic neutrons are mainly scattered in the down-stream direction. Significance. It would be possible to minimize the influence of the heavy ions when measuring the neutron-generated recoil protons by selecting appropriate measurement positions within the phantom. Although there are discrepancies among the three Monte Carlo codes, the results agree qualitatively and in order of magnitude, being sufficient to support further investigations with the ultimate goal of mapping the secondary neutron doses both in- and out-of-field in hadrontherapy.

To fully exploit these advantages, in vivo range monitoring systems are required. These devices measure, preferably during the treatment, the secondary radiation generated by the beam-tissue interactions. However, since correlation of the secondary radiation distribution with the dose is not straightforward, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are very important for treatment quality assessment.        The INSIDE project constructed an in-beam PET scanner to detect signals generated by the positron-emitting isotopes resulting from projectile-target fragmentation. In addition, a FLUKA-based simulation tool was developed to predict the corresponding reference PET images using a detailed scanner model.        The INSIDE in-beam PET was used to monitor two consecutive proton treatment sessions on a patient at the Italian Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO). The reconstructed PET images were updated every 10 s providing a near real-time quality assessment. By half-way through the treatment, the statistics of the measured PET images were already significant enough to be compared with the simulations with average differences in the activity range less than 2.5mm along the beam direction. Without taking into account any preferential direction, differences within 1mm were found.

PTSIM has provided a common platform to model proton and ion therapy facilities, allowing users who are not Geant4 experts to accurately and efficiently run Geant4 simulations with the pre-build configurations. Efforts on further development of PTSIM are still under way to include more functionality and improve the performance. In proton therapy, innovations of treatment machines such as a layer-stacking irradiation system and a pencil beam scanning irradiation system have been made for delivering more ideal dose distributions. In order to perform a specially optimized treatment for each patient, e.g. a tailor made proton therapy, there is a strong request to monitor the dose distribution inside patient by measurements in addition to the calculations. Such dose monitoring is performed by reconstructing dose images by detecting prompt and annihilation gamma rays that are produced from radioisotopes in nuclear interactions by primary protons with patient tissues. The PTSIM has an important roll to simulate the secondary isotope productions, its decay, and the signals in imaging devices in addition to delivered dose distributions.

rayyan-1273750994,Range assessment in particle therapy based on prompt γ-ray timing measurements,"Proton and ion beams open up new vistas for the curative treatment of tumors, but adequate technologies for monitoring the compliance of dose delivery with treatment plans in real time are still missing. Range assessment, meaning the monitoring of therapy-particle ranges in tissue during dose delivery (treatment), is a continuous challenge considered a key for tapping the full potential of particle therapies. In this context the paper introduces an unconventional concept of range assessment by prompt-gamma timing (PGT), which is based on an elementary physical effect not considered so far: therapy particles penetrating tissue move very fast, but still need a finite transit time-about 1-2 ns in case of protons with a 5-20 cm range-from entering the patient's body until stopping in the target volume. The transit time increases with the particle range. This causes measurable effects in PGT spectra, usable for range verification. The concept was verified by proton irradiation experiments at the AGOR cyclotron, KVI-CART, University of Groningen. Based on the presented kinematical relations, we describe model calculations that very precisely reproduce the experimental results. As the clinical treatment conditions entail measurement constraints (e.g. limited treatment time), we propose a setup, based on clinical irradiation conditions, capable of determining proton range deviations within a few seconds of irradiation, thus allowing for a fast safety survey. Range variations of 2 mm are expected to be clearly detectable.",0,,"The abstract does not mention any specific applications of AI in carbon ion therapy; instead, it discusses a physics-based approach to range assessment using prompt γ-ray timing measurements.","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Multiple types of environmental stressors, including PDT, can produce the immunosuppressive lipid mediator plateletactivating factor (PAF). Because PAF can produce subcellular microvesicle particles (MVPs), these studies tested whether PDT can generate PAF and MVP release and whether these are involved in PDT-induced immunosuppression. Previously, topical PDT using blue light and 5-aminolevulinic acid was found to be a potent stimulus for PAF production in mice and human skin explants and human patients, and we show that experimental PDT also generates high levels of MVP. PDT-generated MVPs were independent of the PAF receptor but were dependent on the MVP-generating enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Patients undergoing topical PDT treatment to at least 10% of body surface area showed local and systemic immunosuppression as measured by inhibition of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Finally, using a murine model of contact hypersensitivity, PDT immunosuppression was blocked by genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase and genetic inhibition of PAF receptor signaling. These studies describe a mechanism involving MVP through which PDT exerts immunomodulatory effects, providing a potential target to improve its effectiveness.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their application to carbon ion therapy; it focuses on photodynamic therapy and immunological mechanisms.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The title mentions Topical Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) and bioactive microvesicle particles. From the content, it seems like the study is looking into how PDT affects immunosuppression by generating these MVPs and PAF. They tested this in mice and human skin explants, and also looked at patients who underwent PDT treatment. The findings suggest that PDT leads to immunosuppression through these mechanisms involving MVPs and acid sphingomyelinase. They used various models and inhibitors to block the effects of PAF and MVP generation. So, the main focus is on understanding the immunological effects of PDT and the underlying mechanisms. Now, considering the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY', I need to see if there's any mention or application of AI methods here.

This treatment has minimal side effects and is less invasive. In the therapy, ferromagnetic particles administered into the body are accumulated in the newborn blood vessels. Next, the particles are aggregated to block the blood vessels to prevent cancer growth and metastasis. In this study, we modified the surface of magnetite particles with biocompatible polyacrylic acid to design particles that form irreversible aggregation on the application of a magnetic field. We succeeded in blocking only the flow path under a uniform magnetic field using the prepared particles, as is verified by the results of a model experiment. We assume that the blockage occurred due to the formation of chain aggregation under the magnetic field and the increase in pressure loss.",0,,The article focuses on a novel cancer treatment using magnetite particles to block blood vessels but does not mention or involve any AI methods in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential impacts of particle size on tumor therapy, in consideration of this, lipid/glycocholic acid mixed micelles (LGs) were designed as the model nanocarriers. Doxorubicin (DOX) loaded LGs with two different particle sizes at around 10 nm and 100 nm, respectively, were successfully prepared by controlling the ratio of EPC to GAH. In vitro release study showed that the release behaviors of DOX in mixed micelles with two different particle sizes was basically consistent and showed sustained release. DOX-LGs at 10 nm exhibited higher cellular uptake capacity, compared with DOX-LGs at 100 nm. Besides, in vivo NIFR imaging also demonstrated that DOX-LGs at 10 nm had more accumulation in tumor site. Furthermore, DOX-LGs at 10 nm presented both higher in vitro cytotoxicity and superior in vivo antitumor activity than that of 100 nm. In vivo safety evaluations showed that the mixed micelles had lower toxicities than free DOX solution formulations.

At-211, with a relatively short half-life of 7.2 h, emits an alpha particle within a few cell diameters with high kinetic energy, which damages cancer cells with high biological effectiveness. In this study, we investigated the intravenous injection of At-211-labeled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT). Different kinds of surface-modified gold nanoparticles can be labeled with At-211 in high radiochemical yield in 5 min, and no purification is necessary. The in vivo biodistribution results showed the accumulation of 5 nm At-211-AuNPs@mPEG at 2.25% injection dose per gram (% ID/g) in tumors within 3 h via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Additionally, we observed a long retention time in tumor tissues within 24 h. This is the first study to demonstrate the anti-tumor efficacy of 5 nm At-211-AuNPs@mPEG that can significantly suppress tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer model via intravenous administration. AuNPs are satisfactory carriers for At-211 delivery, due to simple and efficient synthesis processes and high stability.

Emerging evidence suggests that 212Pb-labeled peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals targeting somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) may provide improved effectiveness compared to beta-particle-based therapies for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This study aims to improve the performance of SSTR2-targeted radionuclide imaging and therapy through structural modifications to Tyr3-octreotide (TOC)-based radiopharmaceuticals.MethodsNew SSTR2-targeted peptides were designed and synthesized with the goal of optimizing the incorporation of Pb isotopes through the use of a modified cyclization technique; the introduction of a Pb-specific chelator (PSC); and the insertion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers. The binding affinity of the peptides and the cellular uptake of 203Pb-labeled peptides were evaluated using pancreatic AR42J (SSTR2+) tumor cells and the biodistribution and imaging of the 203Pb-labeled peptides were assessed in an AR42J tumor xenograft mouse model. A lead peptide was identified (i.e., PSC-PEG2-TOC), which was then further evaluated for efficacy in 212Pb therapy studies.ResultsThe lead radiopeptide drug conjugate (RPDC) - [203Pb]Pb-PSC-PEG2-TOC - significantly improved the tumor-targeting properties, including receptor binding and tumor accumulation and retention as compared to [203Pb]Pb-DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotide (DOTATOC). Additionally, the modified RPDC exhibited faster renal clearance than the DOTATOC counterpart. These advantageous characteristics of [212Pb]Pb-PSC-PEG2-TOC resulted in a dose-dependent therapeutic effect with minimal signs of toxicity in the AR42J xenograft model. Fractionated administrations of 3.7 MBq [212Pb]Pb-PSC-PEG2-TOC over three doses further improved anti-tumor effectiveness, resulting in 80% survival (70% complete response) over 120 days in the mouse model.ConclusionStructural modifications to chelator and linker compositions improved tumor targeting and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 203/212Pb peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals for NET theranostics.

We developed a urea-based, At-211-labeled small molecule targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for the treatment of micrometastases due to prostate cancer (PC). Methods: PSMA-targeted (2S)-2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-(4-At-211-astatobenzami do) pentyl)ureido)-pentanedioic acid (At-211-6) was synthesized. Cellular uptake and clonogenic survival were tested in PSMA-positive (PSMA+) PC3 PIP and PSMA-negative (PSMA-) PC3 flu human PC cells after At-211-6 treatment. The antitumor efficacy of At-211-6 was evaluated in mice bearing PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu flank xenografts at a 740-kBq dose and in mice bearing PSMA+, luciferase-expressing PC3-ML micrometastases. Biodistribution was determined in mice bearing PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu flank xenografts. Suborgan distribution was evaluated using alpha-camera images, and microscale dosimetry was modeled. Longterm toxicity was assessed in mice for 12 mo. Results: At-211-6 treatment resulted in PSMA-specific cellular uptake and decreased clonogenic survival in PSMA+ PC3 PIP cells and caused significant tumor growth delay in PSMA+ PC3 PIP flank tumors. Significantly improved survival was achieved in the newly developed PSMA+ micrometastatic PC model. Biodistribution showed uptake of At-211-6 in PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumors and in kidneys. Microscale kidney dosimetry based on alpha-camera images and a nephron model revealed hot spots in the proximal renal tubules. Long-term toxicity studies confirmed that the dose-limiting toxicity was late radiation nephropathy. Conclusion: PSMA-targeted At-211-6 alpha-particle radiotherapy yielded significantly improved survival in mice bearing PC micrometastases after systemic administration.

Seminal plasma immunocaptures yielded amplifiable virion RNA from 13 of 24 (54%) men, and the sequences were primarily associated with markers indicative of macrophage and resident dendritic cell sources. Genetic distances were greatest (>2%) between seminal virions and circulating proviruses, pointing to ongoing low-level expression from tissue-resident cells.

rayyan-1273751010,Using the photon isoeffective dose formalism to compare and combine BNCT and CIRT in a head and neck tumour,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a radiotherapy technique based on the enrichment of tumour cells with suitable 10-boron concentration and on subsequent neutron irradiation. Low-energy neutron irradiation produces a localized deposition of radiation dose caused by boron neutron capture reactions. Boron is vehiculated into tumour cells via proper borated formulations, able to accumulate in the malignancy more than in normal tissues. The neutron capture releases two high-LET charged particles (i.e., an alpha particle and a lithium ion), losing their energy in a distance comparable to the average dimension of one cell. Thus BNCT is selective at the cell level and characterized by high biological effectiveness. As the radiation field is due to the interaction of neutrons with the components of biological tissues and with boron, the dosimetry requires a formalism to express the absorbed dose into photon-equivalent units. This work analyzes a clinical case of an adenoid cystic carcinoma treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), located close to optic nerve and deep-seated as a practical example of how to apply the formalism of BNCT photon isoeffective dose and how to evaluate the BNCT dose distribution against CIRT. The example allows presenting different dosimetrical and radiobiological quantities and drawing conclusions on the potential of BNCT stemming on the clinical result of the CIRT. The patient received CIRT with a dose constraint on the optic nerve, affecting the peripheral part of the Planning Target Volume (PTV). After the treatment, the tumour recurred in this low-dose region. BNCT was simulated for the primary tumour, with the goal to calculate the dose distribution in isoeffective units and a Tumour Control Probability (TCP) to be compared with the one of the original treatment. BNCT was then evaluated for the recurrence in the underdosed region which was not optimally covered by charged particles due to the proximity of the optic nerve. Finally, a combined treatment consisting in BNCT and carbon ion therapy was considered to show the consistency and the potential of the model. For the primary tumour, the photon isoeffective dose distribution due to BNCT was evaluated and the resulted TCP was higher than that obtained for the CIRT. The formalism produced values that are consistent with those of carbon-ion. For the recurrence, BNCT dosimetry produces a similar TCP than that of primary tumour. A combined treatment was finally simulated, showing a TCP comparable to the BNCT-alone with overall dosimetric advantage in the most peripheral parts of the treatment volume. Isoeffective dose formalism is a robust tool to analyze BNCT dosimetry and to compare it with the photon-equivalent dose calculated for carbon-ion treatment. This study introduces for the first time the possibility to combine the dosimetry obtained by two different treatment modalities, showing the potential of exploiting the cellular targeting of BNCT combined with the precision of charged particles in delivering an homogeneous dose distribution in deep-seated tumours.",0,[],The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their application in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273751011,Proceedings to the 7th Annual Conference of the Particle Therapy Cooperative Group North America (PTCOG-NA) 18-20 September 2021 Virtual,"Purpose: Cancer cells produce innate immune signals following detection of radiation-induced cytosolic DNA via signaling pathways such as cGAS-STING. High linear energy transfer (LET) radiations induce more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) per unit dose than low-LET radiations, potentially enhancing immunogenic effects. This work explores the in vitro dose response characteristics of pro-immunogenic interferon-beta (IFN3) and cGAS-STING antagonist three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) from varying-LET radiations. Methods: IFN3 and TREX1 expression were measured in MCC13 cells irradiated with graded doses of x-rays or fast neutrons (comparable LET to carbon-12) via ELISA, immunofluorescence, and qPCR assays. Laboratory measurement of the RBE for IFN3 production (RBEIFN3) and TREX1 upregulation (RBETREX1) was compared to the modeled RBE for DSB induction (RBEDSB) from Monte Carlo DNA damage simulations. RBEIFN3 models were applied to radiation transport simulations to quantify the potential secretion of IFN3 from representative proton, helium-4, and carbon-12 beams. Results: Maximum IFN3 secretions occurred at 5.7 Gy and 14.0 Gy for neutrons and x-rays, respectively (RBEIFN3 of 2.5). TREX1 signal increased linearly, with a four-fold higher upregulation per unit dose for fast neutrons (RBETREX1 of 4.0). Monte Carlo modeling suggests an enhanced Bragg peak-to-entrance ratio for IFNb production in charged particle beams. Conclusion: High-LET radiation initiates larger IFNb and TREX1 responses per unit dose than low-LET radiations. RBEIFN3 is comparable to published values for RBE DSB, whereas RBETREX1 is roughly twofold higher. Therapeutic advantages of high LET versus low-LET radiation remain unclear. Potential TREX1-targeted interventions may enable IFNb-mediated immunogenic responses at lower doses of high-LET radiations.",0,,The article does not mention or apply any AI methods; it focuses on biological responses to different types of radiation without incorporating artificial intelligence techniques.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions a conference about particle therapy cooperative group North America, which sounds relevant because carbon ion therapy is a type of particle therapy. The purpose talks about how cancer cells produce innate immune signals after radiation-induced cytosolic DNA detection via cGAS-STING pathways. They're comparing high-LET and low-LET radiations, with high-LET inducing more DSBs and potentially stronger immunogenic effects. The methods involve measuring IFN3 and TREX1 in cells irradiated with x-rays or fast neutrons (similar to carbon-12). They used ELISA, immunofluorescence, qPCR, and Monte Carlo simulations for DNA damage modeling. Results show higher RBEIFN3 and RBETREX1 for high-LET radiation. The conclusion mentions that therapeutic advantages aren't clear yet but suggests potential interventions targeting TREX1 to enhance immunogenic responses at lower doses of high-LET radiation. Now, looking back at the topic: it's about AI applications in carbon ion therapy. This article discusses biological effects and response mechanisms of different radiations, including those similar to carbon ions (like fast neutrons). However, I don't see any mention of AI methods or techniques being applied here. The methods used are standard biochemical assays and Monte Carlo simulations for modeling DNA damage, but no machine learning, neural networks, or other AI approaches are mentioned.

For example, I-125 radioactive particle implantation and cytokine-induced killer cell therapies have demonstrated efficacy in treating hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanism of this combination therapy remains unknown. In this study, we utilized cytokine-induced killer cells obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells along with I-125 radioactive particle implantation to treat subcutaneous hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft tumors in BALB/c nude mice. The effects of combination therapy on tumor growth, tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation, animal survival, and immune indexes were then assessed. The results indicated that I-125 radioactive particle implantation combined with cytokine-induced killer cells shows a much greater antitumor therapeutic effect than either of the therapies alone when compared to control treatments. Mice treated with a combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy displayed significantly reduced tumor growth. I-125 radioactive particle implantation upregulated the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene A in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and enhanced cytokine-induced killer cell-mediated apoptosis through activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, cytokine-induced killer cells supplied immune substrates to induce a strong immune response after I-125 radioactive particle implantation therapy. In conclusion, I-125 radioactive particle implantation combined with cytokine-induced killer cell therapy significantly inhibits the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vivo and improves animal survival times through mutual promotion of antitumor immunity, presenting a promising therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.",0,,The study focuses on combining radioactive particle implantation and cytokine-induced killer cell therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma without mentioning AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the study is about. The title mentions combining radioactive particle implantation with cytokine-induced killer cell therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in a mouse model. From the content, it seems they're looking at how these two therapies work together—radiotherapy and immunotherapy—and their combined effects on tumor growth, apoptosis, etc. They used I-125 particles and cytokine-induced killer cells from human blood to treat mice with liver cancer xenografts. The results show that the combination is more effective than either therapy alone, affecting tumor growth, survival rates, and immune responses. Nowhere in this abstract do they mention anything about AI methods or carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a specific type of radiation therapy using carbon ions, which wasn't mentioned here—they used I-125 particles instead. Also, there's no indication that any AI techniques were applied in their research; the focus was on biological mechanisms and therapeutic effects. So, since the article doesn't discuss AI applications or relate to carbon ion therapy, it doesn't fall within the scope of the given topic.

rayyan-1273751013,Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System-Based Microdosimetry for the Development of Boron Agents for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy,"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a radiation therapy that selectively kills cancer cells at the cellular level using the boron neutron capture reaction (BNCR) (10B(n.alpha)7Li). The amount of boron B-10 delivers in boronophenylalanine (BPA)-BNCT to achieve anti-tumor effects is approximate to 15-40 ppm. The same is true for all boron drugs; however, whether the same amount of B-10 is required for other boron drugs with different accumulation characteristics has not been intensively investigated. Therefore, herein, a virtual cell model with intracellular organelles is prepared, and the BPA equivalent dose concentration to the cell nucleus is analyzed using particle and heavy ion transport code system-based microdosimetry. Additionally, the intranuclear minimal region (IMR) is set as a reference for the concept of the intranuclear domain in the microdosimetric kinetic model, and the BPA equivalent dose concentration to the IMR is estimated. The required boron delivery dose greatly varies depending on the dose assessment based on the accumulation characteristics of boron agents in intracellular organelles. Evaluation of the BNCR effect according to the accumulation characteristics without being influenced by the specified value of 15-40 ppm is recommended.",0,[],The article focuses on boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) using microdosimetry and does not discuss AI applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the article is about. The title mentions something about a particle and heavy ion transport code system-based microdosimetry for developing boron agents in BNCT, which stands for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. From what I remember, BNCT uses boron compounds that are selectively taken up by cancer cells, and then neutrons cause the boron to release particles that kill the cancer cells without harming surrounding healthy tissue much. So this seems related to neutron therapy rather than carbon ion therapy. The abstract talks about using a virtual cell model with organelles and analyzing BPA equivalent dose concentrations in the cell nucleus using microdosimetry based on particle transport codes. They also mention setting an intranuclear minimal region as a reference for their kinetic model. The conclusion is that the required boron delivery varies depending on how the boron agents accumulate in different organelles, suggesting evaluations shouldn't be limited to the 15-40 ppm range without considering these characteristics. Now, looking at the topic again: it's about AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of particle therapy that uses carbon ions instead of protons or neutrons. It's known for its high precision and effectiveness in treating certain cancers. The article here doesn't mention anything about AI methods or techniques. Instead, it focuses on microdosimetry using transport code systems to analyze boron delivery in BNCT. There's no discussion of machine learning, neural networks, or any other AI technologies that might be applied to optimize treatment plans, improve dose calculations, or personalize therapy for patients undergoing carbon ion therapy. The methods used are more about computational modeling and dosimetric analysis rather than AI applications. Since the article is about BNCT and not carbon ion therapy, and it doesn't involve AI, it doesn't fall within the scope of the given topic. Therefore, I should mark this as '0' because it's outside the specified area of interest."
rayyan-1273751014,Biological Dose Optimization for Particle Arc Therapy Using Helium and Carbon Ions,"Purpose: To present biological dose optimization for particle arc therapy using helium and carbon ions.        Methods and materials: Treatment planning and optimization procedures were developed for spot-scanning hadron arc (SHArc) delivery using the RayStation treatment planning system and FRoG dose engine. The SHArc optimization algorithm is applicable for charged particle beams and determines angle dependencies for spot and energy selection with three main initiatives: (i) achieve standard clinical optimization goals and constraints for target and organs at risk (OARs), (ii) target dose robustness, and (iii) increase linear energy transfer (LET) in the target volume. Three patient cases previously treated at the Heidelberg Ion-beam Therapy Center (HIT) were selected for evaluation of conventional versus arc delivery for the two clinical particle beams (helium [He-4] and carbon [C-12] ions): glioblastoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, and skull-base chordoma. Biological dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) distributions for SHArc were evaluated against conventional planning techniques (volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT] and 2-field intensity modulated particle therapy) applying the modified microdosimetric kinetic model with (alpha/beta)(x) = 2 Gy. Clinical viability and deliverability were assessed via evaluation of plan quality, robustness, and irradiation time.        Results: For all investigated patient cases, SHArc treatment optimizations met planning goals and constraints for target coverage and OARs, exhibiting acceptable target coverage and reduced normal tissue volumes, with effective dose >10-GyRBE compared with conventional 2F planning. For carbon ions, LETd was increased in the target volume from similar to 40-60 to similar to 80-140 keV/mu m for SHArc compared with conventional treatments. Favorable LETd distributions were possible with the SHArc approach, with maximum LETd in clinical target volume/gross tumor volume and potential reductions of high-LET regions in normal tissues and OARs. Compared with VMAT, SHArc affords substantial reductions in normal tissue dose (40%-70%).        Conclusions: SHArc therapy offers potential treatment benefits such as increased normal tissue sparing from higher doses >10-GyRBE, enhanced target LETd, and potential reduction in high-LET components in OARs. Findings justify further development of robust SHArc treatment planning toward potential clinical translation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Internal irradiation of laboratory animals (guinea pigs) and sheep was carried out under laboratory conditions with oral intake of particles simulating the radiation characteristics of young nuclear fission products, at doses that cause medium, severe, and extremely severe forms of radiation ulcerative gastroenterocolitis. During the first four days after radiation exposure, Glauber's salt was administered to each animal once a day either as 3 mL of 20% aqueous solution (for guinea pigs) or as a 0.5 L of 12% aqueous solution (for sheep). In all animals, the drug demonstrated a statistically significant antidote effect. Glauber's salt decreased the severity of radiation-induced ulcerative damage to the gastrointestinal tract, enhanced the speed of healing of radiation ulcers, and increased the survival of animals. The approach applied can be used in the search for new antiradiation antidotes.",0,,"The article focuses on the effectiveness of Glauber's salt as an antidote for radioactive particle incorporation in animals, without mentioning any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273751019,Monte Carlo simulations of new 2D ripple filters for particle therapy facilities,"At particle therapy facilities with pencil beam scanning, the implementation of a ripple filter (RiFi) broadens the Bragg peak (BP), which leads to fewer energy steps from the accelerator required to obtain an homogeneous dose coverage of the planned target volume (PTV). At the Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Germany, a new second generation RiFi has been developed with two-dimensional groove structures. In this work we evaluate this new RiFi design. Methods: The Monte Carlo (MC) code SHIELD-HIT12A is used to determine the RiFi-induced inhomogeneities in the dose distribution for various ion types, initial particle energies and distances from the RiFi to the phantom surface as well as in the depth of the phantom. The beam delivery and monitor system (BAMS) used at Marburg, the Heidelberg Ionentherapiezentrum (HI T), Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Germany and the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany is modeled and simulated. To evaluate the PTV dose coverage performance of the new RiFi design, the heavy ion treatment planning system TRiP98 is used for dose optimization. SHIELD-HIT12A is used to prepare the facility-specific physical dose kernels needed by TRiP, and for recalculating the physical dose distribution after TRiP optimization. Results: At short distances from the RiFi to the phantom surface fine structures in the dose distribution are observed. For various RiFis, ion types and initial particle energies the distance d(max) at which maximum dose inhomogeneity occurs is found and an expression for d(max) is deduced. The distance d(0.01) at which the dose inhomogeneity is less than 1% is estimated and used as a threshold distance at which dose distributions are considered homogeneous. The MC data are found to agree with analytical expressions for d(max) and d(0.01); both are inversely related to the angular distribution. Increasing scatter from the beam delivery and monitoring system results in reduced d(max) and d(0.01). Furthermore, d(max) and d(0.01) are found to be proportional to the RiFi period lambda. Conclusion: Our findings clearly indicate that the dose inhomogeneity induced by RiFis does not add uncertainties to the dose distribution in the clinical setting. The new RiFi design can be used in treatments to obtain homogeneous PTV dose coverage with fewer energy steps while improving lateral penumbra, thereby reducing the required treatment time.",0,,"The article focuses on Monte Carlo simulations for evaluating a new ripple filter design in particle therapy, without involving any AI methods.","Okay, so I need to determine if this article falls within the scope of 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'.

Modified variants of somatostatin, the cognate ligand for SSTR2 and SSTR5, are used in treatment for metastatic and locore-gional disease. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE (DOTA-octreotate), a 0-particle-emitting somatostatin derivative, has demonstrated survival benefit in patients with SSTR-positive NETs. Despite excellent results, a subset of patients has tumors that are resistant to treatment, and alternative agents are needed. Targeted a-particle therapy has been shown to kill tumors that are resistant to targeted 0-particle therapy, suggesting that tar-geted a-particle therapy may offer a promising treatment option for patients with 177Lu-DOTATATE-resistant disease. Although DOTA-TATE can chelate the clinically relevant a-particle-emitting radionu-clide 225Ac, the labeling reaction requires high temperatures, and the resulting radioconjugate has suboptimal stability. Methods: We designed and synthesized MACROPATATE (MACROPA-octreotate), a novel radioconjugate capable of chelating 225Ac at room tempera-ture, and assessed its in vitro and in vivo performance. Results: MACROPATATE demonstrated comparable affinity to DOTATATE (dissociation constant, 21 nM) in U2-OS-SSTR2, a SSTR2-positive transfected cell line. 225Ac-MACROPATATE demonstrated superior serum stability at 37 degrees C over time compared with 225Ac-DOTATATE. Biodistribution studies demonstrated higher tumor uptake of 225Ac-MACROPATATE than of 225Ac-DOTATATE in mice engrafted with subcutaneous H69 NETs. Therapy studies showed that 225Ac-MACROPATATE exhibits significant antitumor and survival benefit compared with saline control in mice engrafted with SSTR-positive tumors. However, the increased accumulation of 225Ac-MACROPA-TATE in liver and kidneys and subsequent toxicity to these organs decreased its therapeutic index compared with 225Ac-DOTATATE. Conclusion: 225Ac-MACROPATATE and 225Ac-DOTATATE exhibit favorable therapeutic efficacy in animal models.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are a promising therapy for IBD. However, cell-tracking studies have shown that intravenously infused MSC localize to the lungs and present short-term survival. To reduce practical complexities arising from living cells, we generated membrane particles (MP) from MSC membranes, which possess some of the immunomodulatory properties of MSC. This study investigated the effect of MSC-derived MP and conditioned media (CM) as cell-free therapies in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. Acute colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by oral administration of 2% DSS in drinking water ad libitum from days 0 to 7. Mice were treated with MP, CM, or living MSC on days 2 and 5. Our findings revealed that MP, CM, and living MSC ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, the loss of colonic goblet cells, and intestinal mucosa permeability, preventing apoptosis of damaged colonic cells and balancing Th1 and Th2 activity.

This was followed by a three-round DELPHI consensus analysis (10/2022) to define recommendations on required actions and future vision. With 70 responses from 17 countries, response rate was 100% for Europe (23/23 centres), 96% for Japan (22/23) and 53% for USA (20/38). Results: Of the 68 clinically operational centres, 85% used RRMM, with 41% using both rescanning and active methods. Sixty-four percent used active-RRMM for at least one treatment site, mostly with gating guided by an external marker. Forty-eight percent of active-RRMM users wished to expand or change their RRMM technique. The main barriers were technical limitations and limited resources. From the DELPHI analysis, optimisation of rescanning parameters, improvement of motion models, and pre-treatment 4D evaluation were unanimously considered clinically important future focus. 4D dose calculation was identified as the top requirement for future commercial treatment planning software.

A simple, scalable, and reproducible strategy is developed to synthesize a drug delivery system (DDS) by loading 6-maleimidocaproyl-hydrazone doxorubicin (DOX-EMCH) into the empty core of virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from Physalis mottle virus (PhMV) via a combination of chemical conjugation to cysteine residues and pi-pi stacking interactions with the anchored doxorubicin molecule. The DOX-EMCH prodrug features an acid-sensitive hydrazine linker that triggers the release of doxorubicin in the slightly acidic extracellular tumor microenvironment or acidic endosomal or lysosomal compartments following cellular uptake.

The neurotropic JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infects glial cells and oligodendrocytes and causes fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in patients with AIDS. In this study, a possible gene therapy strategy for GBM using JCPyV virus-like particles (VLPs) as a gene delivery vector was investigated. We found that JCPyV VLPs were able to deliver the GFP reporter gene into tumor cells (U87-MG) for expression. In an orthotopic xenograft model, nude mice implanted with U87 cells expressing the near-infrared fluorescent protein and then treated by intratumoral injection of JCPyV VLPs carrying the thymidine kinase suicide gene, combined with ganciclovir administration, exhibited significantly prolonged survival and less tumor fluorescence during the experiment compared with controls. Furthermore, JCPyV VLPs were able to protect and deliver a suicide gene to distal subcutaneously implanted U87 cells in nude mice via blood circulation and inhibit tumor growth. These findings show that metastatic brain tumors can be targeted by JCPyV VLPs carrying a therapeutic gene, thus demonstrating the potential of JCPyV VLPs to serve as a gene therapy vector for the far highly treatment-refractory GBM.",0,,The article focuses on gene therapy using viral vectors for glioblastoma treatment without mentioning AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Thrombus formation impedes blood flow to brain and heart and is a principle cause of life-threatening diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Aspirin has been widely used for the treatment and prevention of various cardiovascular diseases, but is unable to target a thrombus and scavenge a high level of H2O2. In this study, we report thrombus targeting aspirin polyconjugate particles (T-APP) as a near infrared imaging agent and on-demand therapeutic agent for thrombotic vascular diseases. T-APP were formulated from H2O2-activatable aspirin polyconjugate, fibrin-specific peptides and fluorescent IR780. In mouse models of tail bleeding and arterial thrombosis, T-APP targeted the thrombosed vessels rapidly with excellent specificity. T-APP also exerted highly strong antithrombotic activity in the thrombosed vessel by suppressing anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting platelet activation. Based on the unique features such as specific thrombus targeting, H2O2 scavenging, and on-demand therapeutic actions, the rationally engineered T-APP have important ramifications on imaging and on-demand therapy of thrombotic disorders.",0,,The article focuses on thrombus-targeting aspirin particles for imaging and therapy but does not mention any AI methods or relate to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

This study is designed to investigate if CMP-001 would enhance head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor response to anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy in a human papilloma virus-positive (HPV+) tumor mouse model. Methods Immune cell activation in response to CMP-001 +/- anti-Q beta was performed using co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HPV+/HPV- HNSCC cells and then analyzed by flow cytometry.In situvaccination with CMP-001 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 was investigated in C57BL/6 mice-bearing mEERL HNSCC tumors and analyzed for anti-Q beta development, antitumor response, survival and immune cell recruitment. The role of antitumor immune response due to CMP-001+anti-PD-1 treatment was investigated by the depletion of natural killer (NK), CD4(+)T, and CD8(+)T cells. Results Results showed that the activity of CMP-001 on immune cell (pDCs, monocytes, CD4+/CD8+ T cells and NK cells) activation depends on the presence of anti-Q beta. A 2-week 'priming' period after subcutaneous administration of CMP-001 was required for robust anti-Q beta development in mice.In situvaccination of CMP-001 was superior to unencapsulated G10 CpG-A ODN at suppressing both injected and uninjected (distant) tumors.In situvaccination of CMP-001 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy induced durable tumor regression at injected and distant tumors and significantly prolonged mouse survival compared with anti-PD-1 therapy alone.

Setup repeatability is ensured by patient-specific immobilization tools and relies on the patient's ability to maintain a stable gaze direction according to the treatment plan. This is facilitated by aligning a light source (LED) on a patient-specific base along the prescribed gaze direction. At CNAO, a dedicated Eye-Tracking System (ETS) was designed to provide the patient with a visible source of light aligned to the desired gaze direction. The ETS position is defined prior to treatment planning, relying on optical-tracking guidance and comparing the position of passive markers fixed on the ETS chassis with patient-specific models prepared offline in accordance with the desired geometry. OPT at CNAO started in 2016 and may be considered as a consolidated clinical routine. However, all the preparation phases, including patient-specific ETS models and setup, still require long sessions in clinical areas such as the computed tomography (CT) and the treatment rooms, with a non-negligible impact on other activities. This study describes a novel approach for patient-specific definition of the ETS position and orientation, aiming at minimizing the time required for preparatory activities inside clinical areas. To minimize the occurrence of biases and to reproduce as much as possible a real end-to-end approach, we included in the analysis data of patients that received OPT in our facility. The study was performed in parallel, carrying out the alignment with the standard method currently used in the clinical workflow of CNAO and with the proposed method. Results are presented as 3D residuals and gaze deviations, comparing ETS alignment based on the new approach with respect to the clinical standard method. The preliminary results of this study are evidence of the capability of the procedure to align the ETS position, allowing performing of the procedure in a non-clinical dedicated room.",0,,The study focuses on setup optimization in ocular proton therapy without involving AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Hadrontherapy, which is a field of still growing interest, is based on the interactions of charged particles with matter. Therefore, there exists a need of creating a simple model that could be used to the calculation of dose distributions in biological matter. Two programs (SRIM, Xeloss), used to the calculation of energy loss by nuclear physicist, have been adapted to determine the dose distributions in analogues of human tissues.

The objective of this work is to compute the optimal dosage of antiretroviral drugs for therapy planning in HIV/AIDS patients, using intelligent optimization techniques. In this work, two computational swarm intelligence techniques known as the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) in conjunction with the three-dimensional mathematical model of HIV/AIDS have been used for estimating the optimal drug dosage for administering therapy by minimization of viral load as well as the total drug concentration. Results demonstrate that, using the proposed method, it is possible to achieve minimal viral load and an improved immune system, with the estimated drug dosage. Further, it was observed that the efficiency of BFO (CD4 cells = 757 cells/mm(3) at seventh year of infection) for estimation of optimal drug dosage is higher than the PSO method (CD4 cells = 817 cells/mm(3) at seventh year of infection).

Methods: Star-shaped gold nanoparticles, gold nanostars (GNS), were used as the platform for At-211 radiolabeling. Radiolabeling efficiency under different reaction conditions was tested. Uptake in the thyroid and stomach after systemic administration was used to evaluate the in vivo stability of At-211-labeled GNS. A subcutaneous U87MG human glioma xenograft murine model was used to preliminarily evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of At-211-labeled GNS after intratumoral administration.        Results: The efficiency of labeling GNS with At-211 was almost 100% using a simple and rapid synthesis process that was completed in only 1 min. In vitro stability test in serum showed that more than 99% of the At-211 activity remained on the GNS after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. In vivo biodistribution results showed low uptake in the thyroid (0.44-0.64%ID) and stomach (0.21-0.49%ID) between 0.5 and 21 h after intravenous injection, thus indicating excellent in vivo stability of At-211-labeled GNS.

In this work, we first synthesized Au seed particles with a diameter of 15.8 nm using a sodium citrate reduction method, and coated Au seeds with polyvinylpyrrolidone for further growth of solid silica shell/mesoporous silica outer shell onto the Au seeds. After treatment via selective etching to remove solid silica shell, amination of surface of the particles, and filling of PFH into the internal cavity of the spheres with a diameter of 182.1 nm, PDA coating was performed to render the particles with an external shell thickness of 15.1 nm.

rayyan-1273751039,Aspects of linear energy transfer (LET) and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in radiation therapy with positively charged particles and the role of electron capture,"In radiotherapy, dose-effect relations induced by Co-60 serve as a reference of the LET and RBE in normal and tumor tissue, which are usually handled by the linear-quadratic model S (LQ) with the parameters alpha and beta, i.e. S = exp (-alpha-D-beta-D-2), working excellently up to the shoulder domain. In particle therapy, we have strictly to differ between RBE in the initial plateau and environment of the Bragg peak. Thus for protons LET and RBE of the initial plateau agree with Co-60, whereas in the Bragg peak domain both properties are increased, but RBE of SOBP (spread out Bragg peak) only varies between 1.1 and 1.17; the RBE of carbon ions is increased once again. Their dose-effect curves are much steeper with a rather small shoulder domain due to dense ionizing radiation. Protons are also dense ionizing in the Bragg peak region, but their magnitude is rather smaller compared to carbon ions. A generalization of the LQ-model based on the nonlinear reaction-diffusion model is proposed to include LET and RBE of dense ionizing particles, which accounts for infra-cellular properties, too. The linear term of the reaction diffusion formula describes destroy of cells, the nonlinear term is related to repair. The diffusion term accounts for the density of the radiation damages. Based on dose-effect properties of Co-60 the parameters of dense ionizing particles can be determined and compared with measurement data. However, a rigorously theoretical access starting with neglect of energy straggling and lateral scatter must account for electron capture of positively charged particles. By mathematical descriptions local dense of radiation effects and their consequences in dose-effect curves are interpreted providing a key to understanding modern therapy planning with different modalities and properties of intracellular processes.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical outcomes of patients treated with charged particle therapy with those of individuals receiving photon therapy.        Methods We identified studies of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumours through searches of databases including Embase, Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration. We included treatment-naive cohorts (both primary and adjuvant radiation therapy) and those with recurrent disease. Primary outcomes of interest were overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional control, at 5 years and at longest follow-up. We used random-effect models to pool outcomes across studies and compared event rates of combined outcomes for charged particle therapy and photon therapy using an interaction test.        Findings 43 cohorts from 41 non-comparative observational studies were included.

rayyan-1273751042,Sialic Acid Conjugate-Modified Liposomal Dexamethasone Palmitate Targeting Neutrophils for Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy: Influence of Particle Size,"Many anti-inflammatory therapies targeting neutrophils have been developed so far. A sialic acid (SA)-modified liposomal (SAL) formulation, based on the high expression of L-selectin in peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) and SA as its targeting ligand, has proved to be an effective neutrophil-mediated drug delivery system targeting rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of particle size of drug-carrying SALs transported and delivered by neutrophils on their anti-RA effect. Dexamethasone palmitate-loaded SALs (DP-SALs) of different particle sizes (300.2 +/- 5.5 nm, 150.3 +/- 4.3 nm, and 75.0 +/- 3.9 nm) were prepared with DP as a model drug. Our study indicated that DP-SALs could efficiently target PBNs, with larger liposomes leading to higher drug accumulation in cells. However, a high intake of large DP-SALs by PBNs inhibited their migration ability and capacity to release the payload at the target site. In contrast, small DP-SALs (75.0 +/- 3.9 nm) could maintain the drug delivery potential of PBNs, leading to their efficient accumulation at the inflammatory site, where PBNs would be excessively activated to form neutrophil extracellular traps along with efficient payload release (small DP-SALs) and finally to induce excellent anti-RA effect.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy; it focuses on drug delivery systems for rheumatoid arthritis.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract again carefully to understand what it's about. The title mentions sialic acid conjugate-modified liposomal dexamethasone palmitate targeting neutrophils for rheumatoid arthritis therapy, and they're looking at how particle size influences this effect. From the content, it seems like the study is focused on drug delivery systems using modified liposomes to target specific cells involved in rheumatoid arthritis. They tested different sizes of these liposomal particles and observed their effects on neutrophils' ability to deliver the drug effectively. The results showed that smaller particles were better at maintaining the drug delivery potential without impairing the neutrophils' migration or payload release, leading to a good anti-RA effect. Now, considering the topic is about AI applications in carbon ion therapy, I need to see if this article relates to either AI methods or carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy typically refers to a type of radiation therapy using carbon ions for cancer treatment. AI applications here might involve things like optimizing treatment plans, predicting outcomes, image analysis, etc. However, the abstract doesn't mention anything about AI, machine learning, algorithms, or any computational methods. It's purely a study on drug delivery mechanisms and particle size effects in treating rheumatoid arthritis. There's no connection to carbon ion therapy either; it's focused on an anti-inflammatory treatment using liposomal drugs. Therefore, this article doesn't fall within the scope of the topic provided. The focus is entirely different—drug delivery for RA versus AI applications in a specific type of cancer therapy. So, I should mark this as not selected with a reason explaining that there's no mention of AI or carbon ion therapy."
rayyan-1273751044,Particle swarm optimizer for weighting factor selection in intensity-modulated radiation therapy optimization algorithms,"In inverse treatment planning of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the objective function is typically the sum of the weighted sub-scores, where the weights indicate the importance of the sub-scores. To obtain a high-quality treatment plan, the planner manually adjusts the objective weights using a trial-and-error procedure until an acceptable plan is reached. In this work, a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) method which can adjust the weighting factors automatically was investigated to overcome the requirement of manual adjustment, thereby reducing the workload of the human planner and contributing to the development of a fully automated planning process. The proposed optimization method consists of three steps. (i) First, a swarm of weighting factors (i.e., particles) is initialized randomly in the search space, where each particle corresponds to a global objective function. (ii) Then, a plan optimization solver is employed to obtain the optimal solution for each particle, and the values of the evaluation functions used to determine the particle's location and the population global location for the PSO are calculated based on these results. (iii) Next, the weighting factors are updated based on the particle's location and the population global location. Step (ii) is performed alternately with step (iii) until the termination condition is reached. In this method, the evaluation function is a combination of several key points on the dose volume histograms. Furthermore, a perturbation strategy - the crossover and mutation operator hybrid approach - is employed to enhance the population diversity, and two arguments are applied to the evaluation function to improve the flexibility of the algorithm. In this study, the proposed method was used to develop IMRT treatment plans involving five unequally spaced 6 MV photon beams for 10 prostate cancer cases. The proposed optimization algorithm yielded high-quality plans for all of the cases, without human planner intervention. A comparison of the results with the optimized solution obtained using a similar optimization model but with human planner intervention revealed that the proposed algorithm produced optimized plans superior to that developed using the manual plan. The proposed algorithm can generate admissible solutions within reasonable computational times and can be used to develop fully automated IMRT treatment planning methods, thus reducing human planners' workloads during iterative processes.

They're talking about optimizing treatment plans using an AI method called PSO to automatically adjust weights without manual intervention. The study involved prostate cancer cases and compared their automated approach with manually adjusted ones, showing better results. Now, the key point is whether this relates to carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a different modality from photon-based IMRT; it uses charged particles (carbon ions) which have different physical properties and are used in specific types of treatments. The abstract doesn't mention anything about carbon ions or particle therapy beyond photons. Therefore, even though the article applies AI in radiation therapy, it's specifically within the context of IMRT using photons, not carbon ion therapy. So, this doesn't fall under the given topic.

The developed Ac-225-SPs possess radiochemical stability and demonstrate effective retention of Ac-225 and its daughter isotopes. The SPs have been additionally labeled with zirconium-89 (Zr-89) to perform the biodistribution studies using positron emission tomography-computerized tomography (PET/CT) imaging for 14 days after intratumoral injection. According to the PET/CT analysis, a significant accumulation of Zr-89-SPs in the tumor area is revealed for the whole investigation period, which correlates with the direct radiometry analysis after intratumoral administration of Ac-225-SPs. The histological analysis has revealed no abnormal changes in healthy tissue organs after treatment with Ac-225-SPs (e.g., no acute pathologic findings are detected in the liver and kidneys). At the same time, the inhibition of tumor growth has been observed as compared with control samples [nonradiolabeled SPs and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]. The treatment of mice with Ac-225-SPs has resulted in prolonged survival compared to the control samples. Thus, our study validates the application of Ac-225-doped core-shell submicron CaCO3 particles for local alpha-radionuclide therapy.",0,[],"The abstract does not discuss any applications of AI in carbon ion therapy; instead, it focuses on the development of calcium carbonate core-shell particles for alpha-radionuclide therapy without mentioning AI methods.","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273751047,A novel method for experimental characterization of large-angle scattered particles in scanned carbon-ion therapy,"Purpose: It is essential to consider large-angle scattered particles in dose calculation models for therapeutic carbon-ion beams. However, it is difficult to measure the small dose contribution from large-angle scattered particles. In this paper, the authors present a novel method to derive the parameters describing large-angle scattered particles from the measured results.        Methods: The authors developed a new parallel-plate ionization chamber consisting of concentric electrodes. Since the sensitive volume of each channel is increased linearly with this type, it is possible to efficiently and easily detect small contributions from the large-angle scattered particles. The parameters describing the large-angle scattered particles were derived from pencil beam dose distribution in water measured with the new ionization chamber. To evaluate the validity of this method, the correction for the field-size dependence of the doses, ""predicted-dose scaling factor,"" was calculated with the new parameters.        Results: The predicted-dose scaling factor calculated with the new parameters was compared with the existing one. The difference between the new correction factor and the existing one was 1.3%. For target volumes of different sizes, the calculated dose distribution with the new parameters was in good agreement with the measured one.        Conclusions: Parameters describing the large-angle scattered particles can be efficiently and rapidly determined using the new ionization chamber. The authors confirmed that the field-size dependence of the doses could be compensated for by the new parameters. This method makes it possible to easily derive the parameters describing the large-angle scattered particles, while maintaining the dose calculation accuracy.

To justify the initiative for building the SEEIIST facility, a study was conducted to estimate the number of patients with cancer from the SEE region that would be eligible for HT.        Methods and Materials: Two different methods for projecting the future annual cancer incidence have been applied: (1) using the International Agency on Research on Cancer@World Health Organization's (WHO) Globocan model which uses country's demographic factors, and (2) averaging the crude incidence data of 3 SEE countries with available national cancer registries, using a linear regression model of combined incidence per 100,000, and applying it to the entire SEE region. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries' cancer datasheets from WHO. The top 10 cancers were presented for the SEE region. Studies of other countries were used to develop a primordial model for estimating the number of SEE patients who could be treated most successfully with HT upon SEEIIST commissioning in 2030.        Results: A model was developed to estimate the number of eligible patients for HT from SEE. It is estimated that 2900 to 3200 patients per year would be eligible for HT in the new SEEIIST facility in 2030.

Alpha emitters (e.g., actinium-225) possess high potency in cancer cell-killing and hold promise for the treatment of malignant tumors. In these preclinical studies, we developed and evaluated CCKBR-targeted alpha particle therapy.

The biodistribution studies of [Ac-225]Ac-PP-F11N revealed CCKBR-specific uptake in tumors, whereas the therapeutic studies demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and extended mean survival time, without apparent toxicity. The histological analysis of kidney and stomach indicated no severe adverse effects after [Ac-225]Ac-PP-F11N administration.

rayyan-1273751050,TOPAS a tool to evaluate the impact of cell geometry and radionuclide on alpha particle therapy,"Due to the increasing clinical application of alpha particles, accurate assessment of their dosimetry at the cellular scale should be strongly advocated. Although observations of the impact of cell and nuclear geometry have been previously reported, this effect has not been fully quantified. Additionally, alpha particle dosimetry presents several challenges and most conventional methodologies have poor resolution and are limited to average parameters across populations of cells. Meaningful dosimetry studies with alpha particles require detailed information on the geometry of the target at a subcellular scale. Methods. The impact of cellular geometry was evaluated for 3 different scenarios, a spherical cell with a concentric nucleus, a spherical cell with an eccentric nucleus and a model of a cell attached to a flask, consisting of a hemispherical oblate ellipsoid, all exposed to 1,700 At-211 radionuclide decays. We also evaluated the cross-irradiation of alpha particles as function of distance to a source cell. Finally, a nanodosimetric analysis of absorbed dose to the nucleus of a cell exposed to 1 Gy of different alpha emitting radionuclides was performed. Results. Simulated data shows the dosimetry of self-absorbed-dose strongly depends on activity localization in the source cell, but that activity localization within the source cell did not significantly affect the cross absorbed dose even when cells are in direct contact with each other. Additionally, nanodosimetric analysis failed to show any significant differences in the energy deposition profile between different alpha particle emitters. Conclusions. The collected data allows a better understanding of the dosimetry of alpha particles emitters at the sub-cellular scale. Dosimetric variations between different cellular configurations can generate complications and confounding factors for the translation of dosimetric outcomes into clinical settings, but effects of different radionuclides are generally similar.",0,,The article focuses on alpha particle therapy dosimetry and does not discuss any AI methods or their application in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Therefore, how to efficiently deliver targeted drugs to tumor sites is a major challenge for current research. The project intends to construct mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with Sora and encapsulate them with exosomes for targeted therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. mPEG-PLGA drug-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by the dialysis method and characterized by TEM and DLS.

One pediatric, two lung and one liver cancer patients were considered in this study. For each patient, 230 and 330 MeV proton, and 500 MeV/nucleon carbon ion pencil beams were simulated through their computed tomography (CT) data set using GEANT4.9.0. Energy, position and direction cosines of each particle were recorded in front and behind the patient. Ion radiographs were subsequently reconstructed using a dedicated in-house software. The image quality was assessed by evaluating the contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumor and its surrounding tissue. In the lung and liver cases, each CT phase of the breathing cycle was treated individually and dynamic sequences were later produced to appreciate tumor motion. Reconstructed radiographs show high spatial resolution. This allows for excellent imaging capabilities in pediatric patients, comparable to X-ray imaging at a fraction of the imaging dose. There is clear visualization of the tumor edges in the lung due to the great contrast-to-noise ratio between the tumor and its surrounding tissues; tumor motion is observed and comparable to 4D CT data thus allowing for on-line tumor tracking during ion radiotherapy. Conversely, tumor edge detection is difficult in liver, and fiducial markers are required to attempt indirect tumor tracking for IGPT.

rayyan-1273751054,Photodynamic Therapy in Combination with the Hepatitis B Core Virus-like Particles (HBc VLPs) to Prime Anticancer Immunity for Colorectal Cancer Treatment,"Simple Summary Photodynamic therapy (PDT) by means of a photosensitizer is a clinically used therapeutic treatment in a variety of cancers. To further improve the anti-cancer efficiency of PDT, combination therapy with immune agents is a promising option. In this study, we used a viral vaccine as the immune therapeutic partner for PDT. We studied the biological properties of single and combined modalities. Our research suggests that combination therapy enhances innate and humoral immunity, improved survival, and generated a long-term memory capacity in the MC-38 murine colorectal tumor model to prevent a recurrence. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which combines light and oxygen with a photosensitizer to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated killing of primary tumor cells, benefits from non-invasive properties and its negligible toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues. In this study, we have shown that the second-generation photosensitizer FOSCAN can be internalized by tumor cells and effectively induce tumor cell death when exposed to laser irradiation in vitro. In addition, these dying tumor cells can be phagocytosed by dendritic cells and lead to their activation and maturation as assessed by in vitro co-culture models. While PDT induces immunogenic tumor cell apoptosis, its application for the treatment of tumors located in deep tissues and advanced malignancies has been limited. In this study, we demonstrate that hepatitis B core virus-like particles (HBc VLPs) can serve as a vaccine to enhance PDT-induced anti-cancer immunity by priming humoral immune responses and inducing CD8(+) T cell responses. The combination of PDT and HBc VLPs increased the survival rate of MC-38 tumor-bearing mice to 55%, compared to 33% in PDT alone and no tumor-free mice in vaccine alone. Moreover, the combination effectively prevented tumor recurrence in vivo through enhanced immune memory T cells after therapy. Therefore, as both are clinically approved techniques, this combination provides a promising strategy for cancer therapy.",0,,The study focuses on photodynamic therapy combined with HBc VLPs for colorectal cancer treatment and does not involve AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273751055,Evaluation of cetuximab as a candidate for targeted α-particle radiation therapy of HER1-positive disseminated intraperitoneal disease,"Although the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), also known as HER1, has been studied for over a decade, it continues to be a molecule of great interest and focus of investigators for development of targeted therapies. The marketed monoclonal antibody cetuximab binds to HER1, and thus might serve as the basis for creation of imaging or therapies that target this receptor. The potential of cetuximab as a vehicle for the delivery of -particle radiation was investigated in an intraperitoneal tumor mouse model. The effective working dose of 10Ci of Pb-212-cetuximab was determined from a dose (10-50Ci) escalation study. Toxicity, as indicated by the lack of animal weight loss, was not evident at the 10Ci dose of Pb-212-cetuximab. A subsequent study demonstrated Pb-212-cetuximab had a therapeutic efficacy similar to that of Pb-212-trastuzumab (p = 0.588). Gemcitabine given 24h prior to Pb-212-cetuximab increased the median survival from 174 d to 283 d, but carboplatin suppressed the effectiveness of Pb-212-cetuximab. Notably, concurrent treatment of tumor-bearing mice with Pb-212-labeled cetuximab and trastuzumab provided therapeutic benefit that was greater than either antibody alone.

Let me read through the abstract carefully. The title is about evaluating cetuximab as a candidate for targeted alpha-particle radiation therapy. Hmm, alpha particles are different from carbon ions. Carbon ion therapy uses heavier ions like carbon, which have different properties compared to alpha particles or other types of radiation. The content talks about using Pb-212-cetuximab in an intraperitoneal tumor mouse model. They discuss dose escalation studies and the effectiveness of this treatment. There's mention of combining it with gemcitabine and trastuzumab, but nothing about AI methods or carbon ions specifically. The focus is on targeted alpha-particle therapy using cetuximab as a delivery vehicle. Since the topic is about AI applications in carbon ion therapy, and this abstract doesn't discuss either AI or carbon ions, it seems like it's outside the scope. Therefore, I should mark it as 0."
rayyan-1273751056,3D-printable lung substitutes for particle therapy on the base of high-resolution CTs for mimicking Bragg peak degradation,"In particle therapy sub-millimeter sized heterogeneities like lung tissue cause a Bragg peak degradation, which should be considered in treatment planning to ensure an optimal dose distribution in tumor tissue. To determine the magnitude of this degradation extensive experiments could be carried out. More convenient and reproducible is the use of our mathematical model to describe the degradation properties of lung tissue and to design 3D-printable substitutes based on high-resolution CT images of human lung samples.        High-resolution CT images of human lung samples (resolution: 4 mu m) were used to create binary cubic datasets with voxels corresponding to either air or lung tissue. The number of tissue voxels is calculated along the z-axis for every lateral position. This represents the ""tissue length"" for all particle paths through the dataset of a parallel beam. The square based lung substitute is divided into columns with different heights corresponding to the occurring tissue lengths. The columns lateral extend complies with the quantity of the corresponding tissue lengths present in the dataset. The lung substitutes were validated by Monte Carlo simulations with the Monte Carlo toolkit TOPAS.        The Monte Carlo simulations proved that the depth dose distributions and hence the Bragg peak degradations of the lung substitutes mimics the degradation of the corresponding lung tissue sample.",0,,The article does not explore or apply any AI methods in its research on particle therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Different radionuclides have been utilized or suggested as suitable candidates. In this study, a dynamic model of metastatic progress was developed and utilized to estimate a radiopharmaceutical's potential of obtaining metastatic control of advanced prostate cancer. The simulations performed demonstrated the advantage of utilizing radionuclides with short-range particle emission, i.e., alpha-emitters and low-energy electrons. The recently-proposed beta-emitting radionuclide terbium-161 demonstrates great potential of being a future candidate towards targeted radionuclide therapy of advanced prostate cancer. This is in line with recent encouraging preclinical results and development of upscaling the product quality. Recently, the first in-human application with a [Tb-161]Tb-DOTATOC also demonstrated good SPECT image quality, which can enable dosimetry calculations for new Tb-161-based radiopharmaceuticals.        The aim of this study was to analyze the required absorbed doses to detectable metastases (D-req) when using radionuclides with prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting radioligands to achieve a high probability for metastatic control. The Monte Carlo based analysis was performed for the clinically-used radionuclides yttrium-90, iodine-131, lutetium-177, and actinium-225, and the newly-proposed low-energy electron emitter terbium-161. It was demonstrated that metastatic formation rate highly influenced the metastatic distribution. Lower values generated few large detectable metastases, as in the case with oligo metastases, while high values generated a distribution of multiple small detectable metastases, as observed in patients with diffused visualized metastases. With equal number of detectable metastases, the total metastatic volume burden was 4-6 times higher in the oligo metastatic scenario compared to the diffusely visualized scenario. The D-req was around 30% higher for the situations with 20 detectable metastases compared to one detectable metastasis. The D-req for iodine-131 and yttrium-90 was high (920-3300 Gy). The D-req for lutetium-177 was between 560 and 780 Gy and considerably lower D-req were obtained for actinium-225 and terbium-161, with 240-330 Gy and 210-280 Gy, respectively. In conclusion, the simulations demonstrated that terbium-161 has the potential for being a more effective targeted radionuclide therapy for metastases using PSMA ligands.",0,,The article focuses on dosimetric analysis of radionuclides for prostate cancer therapy but does not discuss AI applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the study is about. The title mentions a dosimetric analysis of Tb-161 for radionuclide therapy in prostate cancer. From the content, it seems they're looking at different radionuclides and their effectiveness using a dynamic model. They used Monte Carlo simulations with various radionuclides like Yttrium-90, Iodine-131, Lutetium-177, Actinium-225, and Terbium-161. The focus is on the required absorbed doses to achieve metastatic control. They found that Tb-161 has potential as a more effective therapy compared to others. Now, looking at the topic again: it's about AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a specific type of radiation therapy using carbon ions, which is different from radionuclide therapy discussed here. The article doesn't mention anything about AI methods or carbon ion therapy. It's purely about dosimetry and effectiveness of certain radionuclides for prostate cancer treatment. So, there's no overlap between the study's content and the topic provided. Therefore, this article shouldn't be selected."
rayyan-1273751058,α-particle therapy for synovial sarcoma in the mouse using an astatine-211-labeled antibody against frizzled homolog 10,"Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare yet refractory soft-tissue sarcoma that predominantly affects young adults. We show in a mouse model that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with an -particle emitting anti-Frizzled homolog 10 (FZD10) antibody, synthesized using the -emitter radionuclide astatine-211 (At-211-OTSA101), suppresses the growth of SS xenografts more efficiently than the corresponding -particle emitting anti-FZD10 antibody conjugated with the -emitter yettrium-90 (Y-90-OTSA101). In biodistribution analysis, At-211 was increased in the SS xenografts but decreased in other tissues up to 1 day after injection as time proceeded, albeit with a relatively higher uptake in the stomach. Single At-211-OTSA101 doses of 25 and 50 Ci significantly suppressed SS tumor growth in vivo, whereas a 50-Ci dose of Y-90-OTSA101 was needed to achieve this. Importantly, 50 Ci of At-211-OTSA101 suppressed tumor growth immediately after injection, whereas this effect required several days in the case of Y-90-OTSA101. Both radiolabeled antibodies at the 50-Ci dosage level significantly prolonged survival. Histopathologically, severe cellular damage accompanied by massive cell death was evident in the SS xenografts at even 1 day after the At-211-OTSA101 injection, but these effects were relatively milder with Y-90-OTSA101 at the same timepoint, even though the absorbed doses were comparable (3.3 and 3.0 Gy, respectively). We conclude that -particle RIT with At-211-OTSA101 is a potential new therapeutic option for SS.",0,[],The study focuses on α-particle radioimmunotherapy using At-211-labeled antibodies for synovial sarcoma treatment without involving AI or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the article is about. The title mentions α-particle therapy for synovial sarcoma in mice using an astatine-211-labeled antibody against FZD10. From the content, it seems they're comparing two types of radioimmunotherapy: one using At-211 and another using Y-90. They found that At-211 was more effective in suppressing tumor growth compared to Y-90. The study also looked at biodistribution and survival outcomes in mice models. Now, the key here is whether this article discusses AI methods or relates to carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy typically refers to using carbon ions for radiation treatment, which is different from α-particle therapy. Also, I don't see any mention of AI techniques like machine learning, neural networks, or any computational models in the abstract. The focus seems purely on the therapeutic efficacy and biodistribution of these radiolabeled antibodies. Therefore, this article doesn't fall under the scope of applications of AI in carbon ion therapy because it's about a different type of radiation (α-particles) and doesn't involve AI methods."
rayyan-1273751060,Comparative studies on the therapeutic benefit of targeted α-particle radiation therapy for the treatment of disseminated intraperitoneal disease,"Identification of the appropriate combination of radionuclide, target and targeting vehicle is critical for successful radioimmunotherapy. For the treatment of disseminated peritoneal diseases such as pancreatic or ovarian cancer, a-emitting radionuclides have been proposed for targeted radiation therapy. This laboratory has taken a systematic approach investigating targeted a-radiation therapy, allowing comparisons to now be made between At-211, Th-227, Bi-213 and Pb-212. Herein, trastuzumab radiolabeled with At-211 and Th-227 was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in the LS-174T i. p. tumor model. A dose escalation study was conducted with each radioimmunoconjugate (RIC). Therapeutic benefit was realized with (21)1At-trastuzumab with doses of 20, 30 and 40 mu Ci. At doses > 40 mu Ci, toxicity was observed with greater weight loss and 2-fold higher decrease in the platelet counts. Following a second study comparing the effect of 20, 30 and 40 mu Ci of At-211-trastuzumab, 30 mu Ci was selected as the dose for future studies. A parallel study was performed evaluating 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mu Ci of Th-227-trastuzumab. The 0.5 and 1.0 mu Ci injected dose resulted in a therapeutic response; a lower degree of weight loss was experienced by the mice in the 0.5 mu Ci cohort. When the data is normalized for comparing At-211, Th-227, Bi-213 and Pb-212, the choice of radionuclide for RIT is perhaps not entirely based on simple therapeutic efficacy, other factors may play a role in choosing the ""right"" radionuclide.",0,[],The article focuses on targeted alpha-particle radiation therapy using different radionuclides and does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected for the topic 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. The abstract is about targeted alpha-particle radiation therapy using different radionuclides like At-211 and Th-227. They're looking at how effective these are in treating disseminated peritoneal diseases, specifically pancreatic or ovarian cancer. They did studies with trastuzumab radiolabeled with these isotopes and looked at therapeutic efficacy and toxicity levels. The conclusion seems to be that while At-211 was effective up to a certain dose, Th-227 had some benefits too, but other factors besides just efficacy might influence the choice of radionuclide for radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Now, the topic is about AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of X-rays or protons. It's known for its high precision and effectiveness in certain cancers. The article I'm looking at doesn't mention anything about AI methods or techniques.

rayyan-1273751061,Gene therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer cells using JC polyomavirus-like particles packaged with a PSA promoter driven-suicide gene,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men globally. Prostate cancer patients at advanced stages are usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, with disease progression, it often becomes the incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a human DNA virus. Its virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibit similar tropism to native virions and they are capable of delivering exogenous genes to the target cells for expression. JCPyV has been detected in prostate cells; therefore, prostate cancer cells may be susceptible to JCPyV infection and JCPyV VLPs may be used as a vector for gene therapy against prostate cancer. Here we constructed a plasmid (pPSAtk) that allows expression of the thymidine kinase suicide gene only in androgen receptor (AR) positive prostate cancer cells using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter, and used JCPyV VLPs as a vector to carry pPSAtk (PSAtk-VLPs) for transcriptional targeting in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we found that PSAtk-VLPs could only kill AR-positive CRPC 22Rv1 cells in vitro and inhibit the growth of tumor nodules in the xenograft mouse model. Our results reveal that PSAtk-VLPs could potentially be used as a new option for treating CRPC patients in the future.",0,,The study focuses on gene therapy using virus-like particles and does not involve applications of AI in carbon ion therapy.,"The abstract discusses gene therapy using JC polyomavirus-like particles for targeting prostate cancer cells.

Curcumin is a major active constituent of turmeric and is well known for its highly potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. We previously reported antioxidant vanillyl alcohol-incorporated copolyoxalate (PVAX) which is designed to rapidly scavenge H2O2 and release bioactive vanillyl alcohol and CO2 in a H2O2-triggered manner. In this work, we developed curcumin-loaded PVAX (CUR-PVAX) nanoparticles as contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging agents as well as on-demand therapeutic agents for ischemic injuries based on the hypothesis that PVAX nanoparticles generate echogenic CO2 bubbles through H2O2-triggered oxidation of peroxalate esters and the merger of curcumin and PVAX exerts H2O2-activatable synergistic therapeutic actions. CUR-PVAX nanoparticles also displayed the drastic ultrasound signal in ischemic areas by generating CO2 bubbles. CUR-PVAX nanoparticles exhibited significantly higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities than empty PVAX nanoparticles and equivalent curcumin in vascular endothelial cells. A mouse model of ischemic injury was used to evaluate the potential of CUR-PVAX nanoparticles as ultrasound imaging agents and on-demand therapeutic agents. CUR-PVAX nanoparticles significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Moreover, CUR-PVAX nanoparticles significantly enhanced the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also known as CD31), leading to blood perfusion into ischemic tissues. We, therefore, believe that CUR-PVAX nanoparticles hold great translational potential as novel theranostic agents for ischemic diseases such as PAD. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

rayyan-1273751064,Measuring the Impact of Nuclear Interaction in Particle Therapy and in Radio Protection in Space: the FOOT Experiment,"In Charged Particle Therapy (PT) proton or C-12 beams are used to treat deep-seated solid tumors exploiting the advantageous characteristics of charged particles energy deposition in matter. For such projectiles, the maximum of the dose is released at the end of the beam range, in the Bragg peak region, where the tumour is located. However, the nuclear interactions of the beam nuclei with the patient tissues can induce the fragmentation of projectiles and/or target nuclei and needs to be carefully taken into account when planning the treatment. In proton treatments, the target fragmentation produces low energy, short range fragments along all the beam path, that deposit a non-negligible dose especially in the first crossed tissues. On the other hand, in treatments performed using C-12, or other (He-4 or O-16) ions of interest, the main concern is related to the production of long range fragments that can release their dose in the healthy tissues beyond the Bragg peak. Understanding nuclear fragmentation processes is of interest also for radiation protection in human space flight applications, in view of deep space missions. In particular He-4 and high-energy charged particles, mainly C-12, O-16, Si-28 and Fe-56, provide the main source of absorbed dose in astronauts outside the atmosphere. The nuclear fragmentation properties of the materials used to build the spacecrafts need to be known with high accuracy in order to optimise the shielding against the space radiation. The study of the impact of these processes, which is of interest both for PT and space radioprotection applications, suffers at present from the limited experimental precision achieved on the relevant nuclear cross sections that compromise the reliability of the available computational models. The FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target) collaboration, composed of researchers from France, Germany, Italy and Japan, designed an experiment to study these nuclear processes and measure the corresponding fragmentation cross sections. In this work we discuss the physics motivations of FOOT, describing in detail the present detector design and the expected performances, coming from the optimization studies based on accurate FLUKA MC simulations and preliminary beam test results.

Methods: Patients aged >= 40 years who initiated treatment with multi-inhaler triple-inhaled therapy between 1 January 2015 and 31 March were included and followed for 1 year. Patients were grouped according to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose (low/medium/high) and particle size device (extrafine/non-extrafine particles). Outcome variables were moderate and severe exacerbations, pneumonia and healthcare resource use (HCRU) costs. A multivariate analysis was performed for model correction (p< 0.05).        Results: A total of 2185 patients (mean age 72.3 years, 82.9% male) were analysed. Of these, 849 (38.9%) patients received low-dose ICS, 612 medium-dose ICS (28.0%) and 724 (33.1%) high-dose ICS. Exacerbations occurred more frequently with increasing IC dose (low: 26.4%, medium: 28.7% and high: 30.4%; p=0.047), as did the proportion of pneumonia (3.4%, 4.2% and 6.9%, respectively (p=0.041)).

Methods and Materials: From May 2005 to December 2014, 91 patients with nonmetastatic histologically proven unresectable or incompletely resected pelvic BSTSs underwent particle therapy with curative intent. The particle therapy used protons (52 patients) or carbon ions (39 patients). All patients received a dose of 70.4 Gy (relative biologic effectiveness) in 32 fractions (55 patients) or 16 fractions (36 patients).        Results: The median patient age was 67 years (range 18-87). The median planning target volume (PTV) was 455 cm 3 (range 108-1984). The histologic type was chordoma in 53 patients, chondrosarcoma in 14, osteosarcoma in 10, malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in 5, and other in 9 patients. Of the 91 patients, 82 had a primary tumor and 9 a recurrent tumor. The median follow-up period was 32 months (range 3-112). The 3-year rate of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local control was 83%, 72%, and 92%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that chordoma histologic features and a PTV of <= 500 cm(3) were significantly associated with better OS, and a primary tumor and PTV of <= 500 cm(3) were significantly associated with better PFS. Ion type and number of fractions were not significantly associated with OS, PFS, or local control. Late grade >= 3 toxicities were observed in 23 patients. Compared with the 32-fraction protocol, the 16-fraction protocol was associated with significantly more frequent late grade >= 3 toxicities (18 of 36 vs 5 of 55; P<. 001).        Conclusions: Particle therapy using protons or carbon ions was effective for unresectable or incompletely resected pelvic BSTS, and the 32-fraction protocol was effective and relatively less toxic. Nevertheless, a longer follow-up period is needed to confirm these results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

rayyan-1273751068,Yeast Cell wall Particle mediated Nanotube-RNA delivery system loaded with miR365 Antagomir for Post-traumatic Osteoarthritis Therapy via Oral Route,"Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is an acute injury-induced joint inflammation followed by a gradual degradation of articular cartilage. However, there is no FDA-approved Disease-Modifying Osteoarthritis Drug currently. Although gene therapy with microRNA can improve PTOA progression, there is no effective gene delivery vehicle for orally deliver therapeutics due to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we investigated the effect of yeast cell wall particle (YCWP) mediated nanotube-RNA delivery system on PTOA therapy via oral route.        Methods: Nontoxic and degradable AAT and miRNA365 antagomir was self-assembled into miR365 antagomir/AAT (NPs). Then NPs-YCWP oral drug delivery system was constructed by using NPs and non-pathogenic YCWP which can be specifically recognized by macrophages. Moreover, surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus induced PTOA mice model was established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of NPs-YCWP via oral route.        Results: Compared with control group, NPs showed higher gene inhibition efficiency both in chondrogenic cell line and primary chondrocytes in vitro. Treatment of macrophages with fluorescently labeled NPs-YCWP, the results showed that NPs-YCWP was successfully engulfed by macrophages and participated in the regulation of gene expression in vitro. Under the protection of YCWP, miR365 antagomir/AAT passes through the gastrointestinal tract without degradation after oral administration. After NPs-YCWP therapy, the results of histological staining, gene and protein expression showed that miR365 antagomir/NPs-YCWP improved the symptom of PTOA.        Conclusion: Here, we constructed a biodegradable drug delivery system based on non-pathogenic YCWP and nanotubes, which can be used for PTOA therapy via the oral route.

The title mentions a yeast cell wall particle-mediated nanotube-RNA delivery system for post-traumatic osteoarthritis therapy via oral route. Hmm, that sounds like it's about gene therapy using RNA and some delivery mechanism involving yeast particles. The methods section talks about constructing NPs-YCWP by self-assembling AAT and miRNA365 antagomir into nanoparticles, then combining them with YCWP which can be recognized by macrophages.

The conclusion is about creating a biodegradable drug delivery system using YCWP and nanotubes for oral gene therapy in joint degeneration treatment. Now, looking at the topic again: applications of AI in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy used in cancer treatment, I believe. It uses charged particles to target tumors more precisely than traditional X-ray therapy. Applications of AI here might include optimizing treatment plans, predicting outcomes, enhancing imaging accuracy, or automating certain aspects of the therapy process. But this article doesn't mention anything about AI methods like machine learning, neural networks, or any computational techniques. It's purely focused on a novel drug delivery system using yeast particles and nanotubes for gene therapy in osteoarthritis. There's no connection to carbon ion therapy either; it's about delivering RNA via an oral route to treat joint inflammation and cartilage degradation. So, the article doesn't discuss AI applications or relate to carbon ion therapy at all. Therefore, it shouldn't be selected under this topic."
rayyan-1273751070,Two diverse carriers are better than one: A case study in α-particle therapy for prostate specific membrane antigen-expressing prostate cancers,"Partial and/or heterogeneous irradiation of established (i.e., large, vascularized) tumors by alpha-particles that exhibit only a 4-5 cell-diameter range in tissue, limits the therapeutic effect, since regions not being hit by the high energy alpha-particles are likely not to be killed. This study aims to mechanistically understand a delivery strategy to uniformly distribute alpha-particles within established solid tumors by simultaneously delivering the same alpha-particle emitter by two diverse carriers, each killing a different region of the tumor: (1) the cancer-agnostic, but also tumor-responsive, liposomes engineered to best irradiate tumor regions far from the vasculature, and (2) a separately administered, antibody, targeting any cancer-cell's surface marker, to best irradiate the tumor perivascular regions. We demonstrate that on a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-expressing prostate cancer xenograft mouse model, for the same total injected radioactivity of the alpha-particle emitter Actinium-225, any radioactivity split ratio between the two carriers resulted in better tumor growth inhibition compared to the tumor inhibition when the total radioactivity was delivered by any of the two carriers alone. This finding was due to more uniform tumor irradiation for the same total injected radioactivity. The killing efficacy was improved even though the tumor-absorbed dose delivered by the combined carriers was lower than the tumor-absorbed dose delivered by the antibody alone. Studies on spheroids with different receptor-expression, used as surrogates of the tumors' avascular regions, demonstrated that our delivery strategy is valid even for as low as 1+ (ImmunoHistoChemistry score) PSMA-levels. The findings presented herein may hold clinical promise for those established tumors not being effectively eradicated by current alpha-particle radiotherapies.",0,,The study focuses on alpha-particle therapy delivery strategies using two carriers and does not involve any AI methods or applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The title mentions alpha-particle therapy for prostate cancer, specifically targeting PSMA-expressing tumors. The content talks about using two different carriers to deliver alpha particles more effectively within the tumor. They used liposomes and antibodies as carriers, each targeting different regions of the tumor—liposomes for areas far from blood vessels and antibodies for perivascular regions. Their experiments showed that combining these two methods led to better tumor growth inhibition compared to using either method alone. The study also mentions that this approach works even with low PSMA levels in spheroids, which are models of avascular tumor regions. They conclude that this strategy could be clinically promising for tumors not effectively treated by current alpha-particle therapies. Now, considering the topic is about AI applications in carbon ion therapy, I need to see if there's any mention or implication of AI methods being used here. The abstract doesn't talk about machine learning, algorithms, data analysis techniques, or any other AI-related tools. It focuses on delivery strategies using two carriers and their effects on tumor irradiation. Carbon ion therapy is a different modality from alpha-particle therapy; carbon ions are heavier particles used in radiotherapy for their specific dose distribution properties.

rayyan-1273751071,Gene Therapy for Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Using a Suicide Gene Driven by a Lung-Specific Promoter Delivered by JC Virus-Like Particles,"Lung adenocarcinoma, the most commonly diagnosed type of lung cancer, has a poor prognosis even with combined surgery, chemotherapy, or molecular targeted therapies. Most patients are diagnosed with an in-operable advanced or metastatic disease, both pointing to the necessity of developing effective therapies for lung adenocarcinoma. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) has been found to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that human lung adenocarcinoma cells are susceptible to the JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infection. Therefore, we designed that the JCPyV virus-like particle (VLP) packaged with an SP-B promoter-driven thymidine kinase suicide gene (pSPB-tk) for possible gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma. Plasmids expressing the GFP (pSPB-gfp) or thymidine kinase gene (pSPB-tk) under the control of the human SP-B promoter were constructed. The promoter's tissue specificity was tested by transfection of pSPB-gfp into A549, CH27, and H460 human lung carcinoma cells and non-lung cells. The JCPyV VLP's gene transfer efficiency and the selective cytotoxicity of pSPB-tk combined with ganciclovir (GCV) were tested in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. In the current study, we found that SP-B promoter-driven GFP was specifically expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and large cell carcinoma (H460) cells. JCPyV VLPs were able to deliver a GFP reporter gene into A549 cells for expression. Selective cytotoxicity was observed in A549 but not non-lung cells that were transfected with pSPB-tk or infected with pSPB-tk-carrying JCPyV VLPs. In mice injected with pSPB-tk-carrying JCPyV VLPs through the tail vein and treated with ganciclovir (GCV), a potent 80% inhibition of growth of human lung adenocarcinoma nodules resulted. The JCPyV VLPs combined with the use of SP-B promoter demonstrates effectiveness as a potential gene therapy against human lung adenocarcinoma.",0,[],The article focuses on gene therapy using virus-like particles and does not mention any AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Methods: This concept was evaluated in immunocompetent car-cinoembryonic antigen (CEA) transgenic mice bearing CEA-positive mammary or colon tumors. Tumors were targeted with humanized anti-CEA antibody M5A labeled with 225Ac for its 10-d half-life and emission of 4 a-particles, as well as being targeted with the immunocy-tokine M5A-interleukin 2. Results: A dose response (3.7, 7.4, and 11.1 kBq) to TAT only, for orthotopic CEA-positive mammary tumors, was observed, with a tumor growth delay of 30 d and an increase in median survival from 20 to 36 d at the highest dose. Immunocytokine (4 times daily) monotherapy gave a tumor growth delay of 20 d that was not improved by addition of 7.4 kBq of TAT 5 d after the start of immunocytokine. However, TAT (7.4 kBq) followed by immunocyto-kine 10 d later led to a tumor growth delay of 38 d, with an increase in median survival to 45 d. Similar results were seen for TAT followed by immunocytokine at 5 versus 10 d. When a similar study was performed with subcutaneously implanted CEA-positive MC38 colon tumors, TAT (7.4 kBq) monotherapy gave an increase in median survival from 29 to 42 d. The addition of immunocytokine 10 d after 7.4 kBq of TAT increased median survival to 57 d. Immunophenotyping showed increased tumor-infiltrating interferon-g-positive, CD8-positive T cells and an increased ratio of these cells to Foxp3-positive, CD4-positive regulatory T cells with sequential therapy. Immunohistochemistry con-firmed there was an increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T cells in the sequential therapy group, strongly suggesting that immunocyto-kine augmented TAT can lead to an immune response that improves tumor therapy. Conclusion: Low-dose (7.4 kBq) TAT followed by a 4-dose immunocytokine regimen 5 or 10 d later gave superior tumor reductions and survival curves compared with either monotherapy in breast and colon cancer tumor models. Reversing the order of therapy to immunocytokine followed by TAT 5 d later was equivalent to either monotherapy in the breast cancer model.",0,,The study focuses on combining targeted alpha-therapy with immunocytokine therapy to enhance anti-tumor immune responses in mice models.

The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to understand what the study is about. The title mentions improved tumor responses with sequential targeted alpha-particles followed by interleukin 2 immunocytokine therapies in treating CEA-positive breast and colon tumors in mice. So, they're using a combination of two therapies: TAT (targeted alpha-therapy) and immunocytokine therapy. The methods involve using an antibody labeled with Actinium-225, which emits alpha particles, and another treatment that combines interleukin 2 with the same antibody. They tested different dosages and sequences of these treatments in mice models. The results show that combining TAT followed by immunocytokine therapy leads to better tumor growth delay and survival compared to using either treatment alone. They also looked at immune responses, like increased CD8-positive T cells, which are good for fighting tumors. The conclusion is that this sequential therapy approach is more effective than monotherapies in their models. Now, the topic we're focusing on is AI applications in carbon ion therapy. Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses carbon ions instead of X-rays or protons. It's known for its high precision and effectiveness in certain types of cancers. The article I'm reviewing doesn't mention anything about AI methods or techniques. Instead, it focuses on combining two different therapies—alpha-particle targeted therapy and immunocytokine therapy—to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. There's no discussion of machine learning algorithms, data analysis using AI, treatment planning with AI assistance, or any other applications where AI is integrated into the therapy process. The study is more about the biological effects of combining two therapies rather than applying AI technologies to improve carbon ion therapy. Therefore, this article doesn't fall within the scope of the given topic because it lacks any mention or application of AI methods in the context of carbon ion therapy. It's an original research article, but its focus is on immunotherapy and targeted alpha-particle therapy, not AI applications."

The LTL core was utilized for encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) for chemotherapy, and methylene blue (MB) attached NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for NIR-activated bioimaging and leveraging its visible emission for photoexciting MB for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT). The specificity of our LTLs was achieved by conjugating a newly discovered anti-HER2 peptide screened from a phage display peptide library. The high selectivity of the peptide-conjugated LTLs was confirmed by confocal imaging of SKBR-3 (HER2-positive) and MCF-7 (HER2-negative) breast cancer cell lines, illustrating its target-specific nature. The energy transfer from UCNPs to MB was verified, thus enabling the generation of reactive oxygen species upon activation with a 975 nm laser source (0.60 W cm(-2)) under 5 min continuous excitation. A significant decline in the cell viability by 95% was observed using chemo-photodynamic combinational therapy, whereas for chemo-drug alone and PDT alone, the cell proliferation declined by 77% and 84%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated an improved uptake of the LTLs inside a 3D model of SKBR-3 tumor spheroids, where the spheroid cell viability was suppressed by 66% after the use of combinational therapy. Thus, our results suggest great prospective use of theranostic LTLs for breast cancer management.",0,,The article focuses on nanotechnology-based drug delivery and photodynamic therapy for breast cancer without mentioning any AI methods or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

rayyan-1273751074,Optimum size of a calibration phantom for x-ray CT to convert the Hounsfield units to stopping power ratios in charged particle therapy treatment planning,"In charged-particle therapy treatment planning, the volumetric distribution of stopping power ratios (SPRs) of body tissues relative to water is used for patient dose calculation. The distribution is conventionally obtained from computed tomography (CT) images of a patient using predetermined conversion functions from the CT numbers to the SPRs. One of the biggest uncertainty sources of patient SPR estimation is insufficient correction of beam hardening arising from the mismatch between the size of the patient cross section and the calibration phantom for producing the conversion functions. The uncertainty would be minimized by selecting a suitable size for the cylindrical water calibration phantom, referred to as an 'effective size' of the patient cross section, L-effective. We investigated the Leffective for pelvis, abdomen, thorax, and head and neck regions by simulating an ideal CT system using volumetric models of the reference male and female phantoms. The Leffective values were 23.3, 20.3, 22.7 and 18.8 cm for the pelvis, abdomen, thorax, and head and neck regions, respectively, and the L-effective for whole body was 21.0 cm. Using the conversion function for a 21.0-cm-diameter cylindrical water phantom, we could reduce the root mean square deviation of the SPRs and their mean deviation to <= 0.011 and <= 0.001, respectively, in the whole body. Accordingly, for simplicity, the effective size of 21.0 cm can be used for the whole body, irrespective of body-part regions for treatment planning in clinical practice.",0,,The article focuses on optimizing calibration phantom sizes for CT in charged particle therapy but does not involve any AI methods.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

Here we report long-term outcomes from the only randomized, stratified trial comparing CPT with iodine-125 plaque therapy for choroidal and ciliary body melanoma.        Methods and Materials: From 1985 to 1991, 184 patients met eligibility criteria and were randomized to receive particle (86 patients) or plaque therapy (98 patients). Patients were stratified by tumor diameter, thickness, distance to disc/fovea, anterior extension, and visual acuity. Tumors close to the optic disc were included. Local tumor control, as well as eye preservation, metastases due to melanoma, and survival were evaluated.        Results: Median follow-up times for particle and plaque arm patients were 14.6 years and 12.3 years, respectively (P=.22), and for those alive at last follow-up, 18.5 and 16.5 years, respectively (P=.81). Local control (LC) for particle versus plaque treatment was 100% versus 84% at 5 years, and 98% versus 79% at 12 years, respectively (log rank: P=.0006). If patients with tumors close to the disc (<2 mm) were excluded, CPT still resulted in significantly improved LC: 100% versus 90% at 5 years and 98% versus 86% at 12 years, respectively (log rank: P=.048). Enucleation rate was lower after CPT: 11% versus 22% at 5 years and 17% versus 37% at 12 years, respectively (log rank: P=.01).

rayyan-1273770431,Synthetic CT in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy of the Abdominal Site.,"The generation of synthetic CT for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) applications is challenging, since high accuracy is required in treatment planning and delivery, especially in an anatomical site as complex as the abdomen. Thirty-nine abdominal MRI-CT volume pairs were collected and a three-channel cGAN (accounting for air, bones, soft tissues) was used to generate sCTs. The network was tested on five held-out MRI volumes for two scenarios: (i) a CT-based segmentation of the MRI channels, to assess the quality of sCTs and (ii) an MRI manual segmentation, to simulate an MRI-only treatment scenario. The sCTs were evaluated by means of similarity metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, MAE) and geometrical criteria (e.g., dice coefficient). Recalculated CIRT plans were evaluated through dose volume histogram, gamma analysis and range shift analysis. The CT-based test set presented optimal MAE on bones (86.03 ± 10.76 HU), soft tissues (55.39 ± 3.41 HU) and air (54.42 ± 11.48 HU). Higher values were obtained from the MRI-only test set (MAE(BONE) = 154.87 ± 22.90 HU). The global gamma pass rate reached 94.88 ± 4.9% with 3%/3 mm, while the range shift reached a median (IQR) of 0.98 (3.64) mm.

This suggests an unmet need of markers for predicting disease control after re-irradiation and potentially guiding tailored treatment. The purpose of this study was to explore the predictive value of pre-treatment 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission tomography (PET) for patients with locally advanced LR-NPC. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, LR-NPC patients with locally advanced stage (stage III/IV) who received pre-treatment FLT-PET between June, 2015, and August, 2017, were retrospective reviewed and included in this study. OS and local progression-free survival (LPFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses of LPFS were performed. FLT-derived parameters, including SUV(max), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion thymidine (TLT) were examined. The relationship between FLT-derived parameters and mucosal necrosis was tested by the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients with a median follow-up of 31.3 months were included in this analysis. The 2-year OS and LPFS rates were 85.2% and 47.9%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, except for TLT-40% (P=0.059), all pre-treatment MTVs (P=0.040 for MTV-40%; P=0.021 for MTV-50%; P=0.026 for MTV-60%) and TLTs (P=0.043 for TLT-50%; P=0.048 for TLT-60%) were significantly related to LPFS. Moreover, MTVs and TLTs with various boundaries (except for MTV-40%) were also associated with the development of mucosal necrosis after CIRT. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, a significant association between pre-treatment FLT-PET and LPFS was observed in patients with locally advanced LR-NPC.

rayyan-1273770443,"Management of Motion and Anatomical Variations in Charged Particle Therapy: Past, Present, and Into the Future.","The major aim of radiation therapy is to provide curative or palliative treatment to cancerous malignancies while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Charged particle radiotherapy utilizing carbon ions or protons is uniquely suited for this task due to its ability to achieve highly conformal dose distributions around the tumor volume. For these treatment modalities, uncertainties in the localization of patient anatomy due to inter- and intra-fractional motion present a heightened risk of undesired dose delivery. A diverse range of mitigation strategies have been developed and clinically implemented in various disease sites to monitor and correct for patient motion, but much work remains. This review provides an overview of current clinical practices for inter and intra-fractional motion management in charged particle therapy, including motion control, current imaging and motion tracking modalities, as well as treatment planning and delivery techniques. We also cover progress to date on emerging technologies including particle-based radiography imaging, novel treatment delivery methods such as tumor tracking and FLASH, and artificial intelligence and discuss their potential impact towards improving or increasing the challenge of motion mitigation in charged particle therapy.",0,,"The article is a review, not an original research article, and while it mentions AI in the context of charged particle therapy, it does not focus specifically on applications within carbon ion therapy.","Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions management of motion and anatomical variations in charged particle therapy, which includes carbon ions as mentioned in the content. The abstract talks about radiation therapy aiming to treat cancer while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Charged particles like protons or carbon ions are used because they can deliver doses more conformally around tumors. However, uncertainties due to patient motion during treatment pose a risk of incorrect dose delivery. They discuss various mitigation strategies that have been developed and implemented clinically. The article is a review covering current clinical practices for managing inter- and intra-fractional motion in charged particle therapy. It also covers emerging technologies like particle-based radiography imaging, tumor tracking, FLASH, and artificial intelligence (AI). The authors discuss the potential impact of AI on improving or increasing challenges in motion mitigation within this therapy. Now, considering that the article is a review, not an original research article, it doesn't present new data or methods but rather summarizes existing literature. Since the user specified to select only ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES, this one wouldn't qualify. Additionally, while AI is mentioned as part of emerging technologies, the focus isn't specifically on applications within carbon ion therapy but more broadly in charged particle therapy. Therefore, even if it were an original research article, its scope might not be narrow enough for the given topic. So, I should mark this with a '0' because it's a review and doesn't fit the criteria of being an original research article focused on AI applications specifically in carbon ion therapy."
rayyan-1273770449,In-vitro 3D modelling for charged particle therapy - Uncertainties and opportunities.,"Radiation therapy is a critical component of oncologic management, with more than half of all cancer patients requiring radiotherapy at some point during their disease course. Over the last decade, there has been increasing interest in charged particle therapy due to its advantageous physical and radiobiologic properties, with the therapeutic use of proton beam therapy (PBT) expanding worldwide. However, there remain large gaps in our knowledge of the radiobiologic mechanisms that underlie key aspects of PBT, such as variations in relative biologic effectiveness (RBE), radioresistance, DNA damage response and repair pathways, as well as immunologic effects. In addition, while the emerging technique of ultra-high dose rate or FLASH radiotherapy, with its potential to further reduce normal tissue toxicities, is an exciting development, in-depth study is needed into the postulated biochemical mechanisms that underpin the FLASH effect such as the oxygen depletion hypothesis as well as the relative contributions of immune responses and the tumor microenvironment. Further investigation is also required to ensure that the FLASH effect is not diminished or lost in PBT. Current methods to evaluate the biologic effects of charged particle therapy rely heavily on 2D cell culture systems and/or animal models. However, both of these methods have well-recognized limitations which limit translatability of findings from bench to bedside. The advent of novel three-dimensional in-vitro tumor models offers a more physiologically relevant and high throughput in-vitro system for the study of tumor development as well as novel therapeutic approaches such as PBT. Advances in 3D cell culture methods, together with knowledge of disease mechanism, biomarkers, and genomic data, can be used to design personalized 3D models that most closely recapitulate tumor microenvironmental factors promoting a particular disease phenotype, moving 3D models and PBT into the age of precision medicine.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or their applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions in-vitro 3D modeling for charged particle therapy, which includes protons and maybe carbon ions since they're both types of charged particles. The content talks about radiation therapy, specifically proton beam therapy (PBT), and discusses uncertainties and opportunities in their use. It also touches on ultra-high dose rate or FLASH radiotherapy as an exciting development but notes that more study is needed into the mechanisms behind it. The article emphasizes the limitations of current methods like 2D cell cultures and animal models and suggests that 3D tumor models could offer a better system for studying therapeutic effects, including PBT. It mentions designing personalized 3D models using advances in cell culture methods along with disease mechanism knowledge, biomarkers, and genomic data to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. However, I don't see any mention of AI or machine learning techniques being applied here. The focus is more on the biological modeling aspects rather than computational methods like AI. Since the topic specifically asks about applications of AI in carbon ion therapy, and this article doesn't discuss any AI methods, it doesn't fit the scope. Therefore, I should mark it as 0."
rayyan-1273770456,Clinical practice vs. state-of-the-art research and future visions: Report on the 4D treatment planning workshop for particle therapy - Edition 2018 and 2019.,"The 4D Treatment Planning Workshop for Particle Therapy, a workshop dedicated to the treatment of moving targets with scanned particle beams, started in 2009 and since then has been organized annually. The mission of the workshop is to create an informal ground for clinical medical physicists, medical physics researchers and medical doctors interested in the development of the 4D technology, protocols and their translation into clinical practice. The 10th and 11th editions of the workshop took place in Sapporo, Japan in 2018 and Krakow, Poland in 2019, respectively. This review report from the Sapporo and Krakow workshops is structured in two parts, according to the workshop programs. The first part comprises clinicians and physicists review of the status of 4D clinical implementations. Corresponding talks were given by speakers from five centers around the world: Maastro Clinic (The Netherlands), University Medical Center Groningen (The Netherlands), MD Anderson Cancer Center (United States), University of Pennsylvania (United States) and The Proton Beam Therapy Center of Hokkaido University Hospital (Japan). The second part is dedicated to novelties in 4D research, i.e. motion modelling, artificial intelligence and new technologies which are currently being investigated in the radiotherapy field.",0,,The article is a review report and does not present original research on AI applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be selected based on its abstract. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON IION THERAPY'. Let me read the abstract carefully. The title mentions a workshop report on 4D treatment planning for particle therapy in 2018 and 2019. The content talks about the workshop's mission to discuss clinical implementations and research novelties, including motion modeling, AI, and new technologies in radiotherapy. It also lists some centers involved but doesn't specify if they're using carbon ions or another type of particle therapy. The abstract mentions that the second part is dedicated to novelties like AI, but it's a review report, not an original research article. Since the user specified that only ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES should be considered and this is a review, I shouldn't select it. Also, there's no mention of carbon ions specifically; it just refers to particle therapy in general. Therefore, even if AI was discussed, without focusing on carbon ion therapy, it doesn't fit the topic. So, my decision is 0."
rayyan-1273770467,Particle therapy tumour outcomes: An updated systematic review.,"Particle therapy (PT) offers the potential for reduced normal tissue damage as well as escalation of target dose, thereby enhancing the therapeutic ratio in radiation therapy. Reflecting the building momentum of PT use worldwide, construction has recently commenced for The Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy and Research in Adelaide - the first PT centre in Australia. This systematic review aims to update the clinical evidence base for PT, both proton beam and carbon ion therapy. The purpose is to inform clinical decision-making for referral of patients to PT centres in Australia as they become operational and overseas in the interim. Three major databases were searched by two independent researchers, and evidence quality was classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. One hundred and thirty-six studies were included, two-thirds related to proton beam therapy alone. PT at the very least provides equivalent tumour outcomes compared to photon controls with the possibility of improved control in the case of carbon ion therapy. There is suggestion of reduced morbidities in a range of tumour sites, supporting the predictions from dosimetric modelling and the wide international acceptance of PT for specific indications based on this. Though promising, this needs to be counterbalanced by the overall low quality of evidence found, with 90% of studies of level IV (case series) evidence. Prospective comparative clinical trials, supplemented by database-derived outcome information, preferably conducted within international and national networks, are strongly recommended as PT is introduced into Australasia.",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications in carbon ion therapy; it is a systematic review of existing studies on particle therapy outcomes.,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions a systematic review about particle therapy tumour outcomes, specifically looking at proton beam and carbon ion therapy. The content talks about the potential benefits of PT compared to photon therapy, like reduced normal tissue damage and better dose escalation. It also discusses the construction of a new center in Australia for PT. The abstract goes on to say that they reviewed 136 studies, mostly about proton therapy, but some about carbon ion as well. They found that PT provides equivalent or possibly better tumour outcomes than photon therapy, with reduced morbidities. However, most of the evidence is low quality, and they recommend more clinical trials. Nowhere in this abstract do I see any mention of AI methods or applications related to carbon ion therapy. It's a systematic review summarizing existing studies but doesn't discuss AI techniques like machine learning, algorithms, predictive models, etc., that could be applied in the context of carbon ion therapy. Since the article is a review and not an original research article, it also doesn't fit the requirement for being an ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE. Therefore, this should not be selected under the given topic."
rayyan-1273770472,The Importance and Clinical Implications of FLASH Ultra-High Dose-Rate Studies for Proton and Heavy Ion Radiotherapy.,"The goal of radiation therapy is to provide the highest probability of tumor control while minimizing normal tissue toxicity. Recently, it has been discovered that ultra-high dose rates of ionizing radiation may preferentially spare normal tissue over tumor tissue. This effect, referred to as FLASH radiotherapy, has been observed in various animal models as well as, more recently, in a human patient. This effect may be related to the cell sparing found in vitro at ultra-high dose rates of photons and electrons dating back to the 1960s. Conditions representative of physiologic oxygen were found to be essential for this process to occur. However, there is no conclusive data on whether this effect occurs with protons, as all results to date have been in cells irradiated at ambient oxygen conditions. There have been no ultra-high dose-rate experiments with heavy ions, which would be relevant to the implementation of FLASH to carbon-ion therapy. These basic science results are critical in guiding this rapidly advancing field, since clinical particle therapy machines capable of FLASH dose rates have already been promoted for protons. To help ensure FLASH radiotherapy is reliable and maximally effective, the radiobiology must keep ahead of the clinical implementation to help guide it. In this context, in vitro and in vivo proton and heavy ion experiments involving FLASH dose rates need to be performed to evaluate not only short-term consequences, but also sequelae related to long-term health risks. Critical to these future studies is consideration of relevant oxygen tensions at the time of irradiation, as well as appropriate in silico modeling to assist in understanding the initial physicochemical events.",0,,The abstract does not discuss any AI methods or applications in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions FLASH ultra-high dose-rate studies for proton and heavy ion radiotherapy. Heavy ions include carbon ions, so that's relevant. The content talks about the effects of high dose rates on normal tissue versus tumor tissue, which is important for therapy. It also mentions experiments needed with protons and heavy ions at these dose rates, including in vitro and in vivo studies. They mention considering oxygen tensions and appropriate in silico modeling to understand initial events. Nowhere in the abstract do they talk about AI methods or applications of AI specifically. The focus seems more on radiobiology and experimental setups rather than any AI techniques like machine learning, neural networks, etc. So even though it's related to carbon ion therapy, since there's no mention of AI, it doesn't fit the topic. Therefore, I should mark this as 0."
rayyan-1273770477,Concepts and terms for dose/volume parameters in carbon-ion radiotherapy: Conclusions of the ULICE taskforce.,"PURPOSE: The Union of Light Ion Centers in Europe (ULICE) program addressed the need for uniting scientific results for carbon-ion radiation therapy obtained by several institutions worldwide in different fields of excellence, and translating them into a real benefit to the community. Particularly, the concepts for dose/volume parameters developed in photon radiotherapy cannot be extrapolated to high linear energy transfer particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ULICE-WP2 taskforce included radiation oncologists involved in carbon-ion radiation therapy and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, radiation biologists, expert physicists in the fields of carbon-ion radiation therapy, microdosimetry, biological modeling and image-guided radiotherapy. Consensual reports emerged from multiple discussions within both the restricted group and the wider ULICE community. Public deliverables were produced and disseminated to the European Commission. RESULTS: Here we highlight the disparity in practices between treating centers, then address the main topics to finally elaborate specific recommendations. Although it appears relatively simple to add geometrical margins around the clinical target volume to obtain the planning target volume as performed in photon radiotherapy, this procedure is not appropriate for carbon-ion radiation therapy. Due to the variation of the radiation quality in depth, there is no generic relative biological effectiveness value for carbon-ions outside of an isolated point, for a given fractionation and specific experimental conditions. Absorbed dose and ""equieffective dose"" for specified conditions must always be reported. CONCLUSIONS: This work contributed to the development of standard operating procedures for carbon-ion radiation therapy clinical trials. These procedures are now being applied, particularly in the first phase III international, multicenter trial (PHRC Étoile).",0,,The abstract does not mention any AI methods or applications in carbon-ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic. The topic is 'APPLICATIONS OF AI IN CARBON ION THERAPY'. Let me read through the abstract carefully to see if it fits. The title mentions concepts and terms for dose/volume parameters in carbon-ion radiotherapy, specifically from a taskforce called ULICE. The purpose talks about uniting scientific results from various institutions to benefit the community. They mention that photon radiotherapy methods don't apply to high linear energy transfer particles like carbon ions. The methods include radiation oncologists, physicists, and others working together to produce reports and recommendations. The results highlight disparities in practices between centers and provide specific recommendations for dose/volume parameters. The conclusion is about developing standard operating procedures for clinical trials, especially a phase III trial called PHRC Étoile. Nowhere in the abstract do they mention AI methods or applications. They're more focused on establishing guidelines and understanding dose parameters rather than using any AI techniques. So, since there's no mention of AI, this article doesn't fall under the topic we're looking for. Therefore, it should be rejected."
rayyan-1273770482,Overview of research and therapy facilities for radiobiological experimental work in particle therapy. Report from the European Particle Therapy Network radiobiology group.,"Particle therapy (PT) as cancer treatment, using protons or heavier ions, can provide a more favorable dose distribution compared to X-rays. While the physical characteristics of particle radiation have been the aim of intense research, less focus has been placed on the actual biological responses arising from particle irradiation. One of the biggest challenges for proton radiobiology is the RBE, with an increasing concern that the clinically-applied generic RBE-value of 1.1 is an approximation, as RBE is a complex quantity, depending on both biological and physical parameters, such as dose, LET, cellular and tissue radiobiological characteristics, as well as the endpoints being studied. Most of the available RBE data derive from in vitro experiments, with very limited in vivo data available, especially in late-reacting tissues, which provide the main constraints and influence the quality of life endpoints in radiotherapy. There is a need for systematic, large-scale studies to thoroughly establish the biology of particle radiation in a number of different experimental models in order to refine biophysical mathematical models that can potentially be used to guide PT. The overall objective of the European Particle Therapy Network (EPTN) WP6 is to form a network of research and therapy facilities in order to coordinate and standardize the radiobiological experiments, to obtain more accurate predictive parameters than in the past. Coordinated research is required in order to obtain the most appropriate experimental data. The aim in this paper is to describe the available radiobiology infrastructure of the centers involved in EPTN WP6.",0,,The article focuses on radiobiological experimental work and coordination of research facilities in particle therapy but does not discuss any applications of AI in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this article should be selected based on the given topic.

The content talks about particle therapy using protons or heavier ions, comparing them to X-rays. It discusses the biological responses to particle irradiation, challenges with RBE (relative biological effectiveness), and mentions that most data comes from in vitro experiments with limited in vivo data, especially in late-reacting tissues. There's a need for systematic studies to establish the biology of particle radiation and refine biophysical models for PT guidance. The EPTN WP6 aims to coordinate radiobiological experiments across facilities to get more accurate predictive parameters. The paper describes the available infrastructure of these centers involved in EPTN WP6. Now, looking at this, I don't see any mention of AI methods or applications. It's focused on coordinating research facilities and discussing biological aspects of particle therapy but doesn't touch on how AI is used in carbon ion therapy. Therefore, it doesn't fall within the scope of the topic provided."
