Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from \"always-on\" signals, which complicate organ-specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH-responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH-sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal-to-noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual-function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH-switchable enzyme-like catalysis with dual-key co-activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe-related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI\\'s applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.        This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment-adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non-specific liver uptake. image', 'notes': 'Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {\"Giulia\"=>\"Excluded\", \"Sithin\"=>\"Excluded\", \"LLM\"=>\"Excluded\"} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not AI, Not CIRT | USER-NOTES: {\"LLM\"=>[\"No, the abstract does not specifically mention the application of AI in carbon ion therapy; it focuses on the development of a responsive magnetic particle imaging tracer for enhanced imaging and adaptive cancer therapy.\"]}'}\n"
