rayyan-97865221,"Responsive Magnetic Particle Imaging Tracer: Overcoming ""Always-On"" Limitation, Eliminating Interference, and Ensuring Safety in Adaptive Therapy","Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a novel technology utilizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as tracers, essential for disease diagnosis and treatment guidance in preclinical animal models. Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from ""always-on"" signals, which complicate organ-specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH-responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH-sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal-to-noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual-function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH-switchable enzyme-like catalysis with dual-key co-activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe-related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.        This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment-adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non-specific liver uptake. image",0,The abstract discusses advancements in magnetic particle imaging tracers but does not mention AI methods or their application in carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine if this article is relevant to the topic of applications of AI methods in carbon ion therapy. The abstract talks about Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) tracers that are responsive and can overcome some limitations like 'always-on' signals and interference. They mention using pH-responsive PdFe alloy particles with a gatekeeper polymer, which allows for selective imaging and better signal-to-noise ratios. There's also something about adaptive cancer therapy combining enzyme-like catalysis, ROS generation, and free radical scavenging to minimize toxicity. The tracer helps in subtraction-enhanced MPI imaging, improving diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic monitoring. However, the abstract doesn't mention anything about AI methods or carbon ion therapy specifically. It focuses more on the development of a new imaging tracer for better diagnostics and treatment guidance in cancer. Since there's no direct link to AI applications or carbon ions, this article might not be relevant for the literature review on that specific topic."
rayyan-97865222,"The role of apoptosis, immunogenic cell death, and macrophage polarization in carbon ion radiotherapy for keloids: Targeting the TGF-β1/ SMADs signaling pathway","Keloids, characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and aberrant fibrous tissue proliferation, present significant therapeutic challenges due to their recalcitrant and recurrent nature. This study explores the efficacy of Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT) as a novel therapeutic approach for keloids, focusing on its impact on fibroblast proliferation, apoptosis induction, immunogenic cell death (ICD), macrophage polarization, and the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway. Utilizing a murine model of keloid formed by subcutaneous injection of zeocin in C57BL/6 mice, we demonstrated that CIRT effectively reduces collagenous fiber synthesis and collagen production in keloid tissues. Further, CIRT was shown to inhibit keloid fibroblast proliferation and to induce apoptosis, as evidenced by increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins and confirmed through flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Notably, CIRT induced mitochondrial stress, leading to enhanced immunogenicity of cell death, characterized by increased expression of ICD markers and secretion of interferon-y. Additionally, CIRT promoted a shift from M2 to M1 macrophage polarization, potentially reducing TGF-beta release and mitigating ECM deposition. Our findings suggest that CIRT mediates its therapeutic effects through the inhibition of the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway, thereby attenuating ECM formation and offering a promising avenue for keloid treatment. This study underscores the potential of CIRT as an innovative strategy for managing keloids, highlighting its multifaceted impact on key cellular processes involved in keloid pathogenesis.",0,The abstract focuses on biological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of carbon ion radiotherapy but does not mention any AI methods or applications.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article should be included in a literature review about the applications of AI methods in carbon ion therapy. The abstract provided is about a study using Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT) for treating keloids. It discusses how CIRT affects fibroblast proliferation, apoptosis, immunogenic cell death, macrophage polarization, and the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway. They used a murine model to demonstrate these effects. The article seems focused on the biological mechanisms of CIRT rather than any AI methods or applications. There's no mention of machine learning, algorithms, data analysis techniques, or any other AI-related tools being used in their research. Therefore, while it provides valuable insights into how CIRT works for keloids, it doesn't address the use of AI in this context. So, I don't think this article is relevant to the given topic."

This study aims to assess the composition of scattered particles generated in proton therapy for tumors situated proximal to some titanium (Ti) dental implants. The investigation involves decomposing the mixed field and recording Linear Energy Transfer (LET) spectra to quantify the influence of metallic dental inserts located behind the tumor. Approach. A therapeutic conformal proton beam was used to deliver the treatment plan to an anthropomorphic head phantom with two types of implants inserted in the target volume (made of Ti and plastic, respectively). The scattered radiation resulted during the irradiation was detected by a hybrid semiconductor pixel detector MiniPIX Timepix3 that was placed distal to the Spread-out Bragg peak. Visualization and field decomposition of stray radiation were generated using algorithms trained in particle recognition based on artificial intelligence neural networks (AI NN). Spectral sensitive aspects of the scattered radiation were collected using two angular positions of the detector relative to the beam direction: 0 degrees and 60 degrees. Results. Using AI NN, 3 classes of particles were identified: protons, electrons & photons, and ions & fast neutrons. Placing a Ti implant in the beam's path resulted in predominantly electrons and photons, contributing 52.2% of the total number of detected particles, whereas for plastic implants, the contribution was 65.4%. Scattered protons comprised 45.5% and 31.9% with and without metal inserts, respectively. The LET spectra were derived for each group of particles identified, with values ranging from 0.01 to 7.5 keV mu m-1 for Ti implants/plastic implants. The low-LET component was primarily composed of electrons and photons, while the high-LET component corresponded to protons and ions. Significance. This method, complemented by directional maps, holds the potential for evaluating and validating treatment plans involving stray radiation near organs at risk, offering precise discrimination of the mixed field, and enhancing in this way the LET calculation.",0,"The article focuses on proton therapy rather than carbon ion therapy, even though it uses AI methods for particle recognition and LET evaluation.","Okay, so I need to determine if this article is relevant to the topic of applications of AI methods in carbon ion therapy. Let me read through the abstract carefully. The title mentions particle tracking, recognition, and LET evaluation using a proton therapy setup with implants. The content talks about assessing scattered particles during proton therapy near titanium dental implants. They used an AI neural network for particle recognition. The results show classification into protons, electrons/photons, and ions/fast neutrons. The significance mentions evaluating treatment plans involving stray radiation and enhancing LET calculation. Now, the topic is specifically about carbon ion therapy, but this article uses proton therapy. However, both are types of particle therapy, so there might be some overlap in AI applications. But since it's not directly about carbon ions, maybe it's less relevant. I'm a bit unsure because while the methods could potentially apply to carbon ions, the focus here is on protons. So perhaps this isn't the best fit for the literature review on carbon ion therapy specifically."
rayyan-97865227,Understanding Relative Biological Effectiveness and Clinical Outcome of Prostate Cancer Therapy Using Particle Irradiation : Analysis of Tumor Control Probability With the Modified Microdosimetric Kinetic Model,"Purpose: Recent experimental studies and clinical trial results might indicate that-at least for some indications-continued use of the mechanistic model for relative biological effectiveness (RBE) applied at carbon ion therapy facilities in Europe for several decades (LEM-I) may be unwarranted. We present a novel clinical framework for prostate cancer treatment planning and tumor control probability (TCP) prediction based on the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM) for particle therapy. Methods and Materials: Treatment plans of 91 patients with prostate tumors (proton: 46, carbon ions: 45) applying 66 GyRBE [RBE = 1.1 for protons and LEM-I, (a/b)x = 2.0 Gy, for carbon ions] in 20 fractions were recalculated using mMKM [(a/b)x = 3.1 Gy]). Based solely on the response data of photon-irradiated patient groups stratified according to risk and usage of androgen deprivation therapy, we derived parameters for an mMKM-based Poisson-TCP model. Subsequently, new carbon and helium ion plans, adhering to prescribed biological dose criteria, were generated. These were systematically compared with the clinical experience of Japanese centers employing an analogous fractionation scheme and existing proton plans. Results: mMKM predictions suggested significant biological dose deviation between the proton and carbon ion arms. Patients irradiated with protons received (3.25 f 0.08) GyRBEmMKM/Fx, whereas patients treated with carbon ions received (2.51 f 0.05) GyRBEmMKM/Fx. TCP predictions were (86 f 3)% for protons and (52 f 4)% for carbon ions, matching the clinical outcome of 85% and 50%. Newly optimized carbon ion plans, guided by the mMKM/TCP model, effectively replicated clinical data from Japanese centers. Using mMKM, helium ions exhibited similar target coverage as proton and carbon ions and improved rectum and bladder sparing compared with proton. Conclusions: Our mMKM-based model for prostate cancer treatment planning and TCP prediction was validated against clinical data for proton and carbon ion therapy, and its application was extended to helium ion therapy. Based on the data presented in this work, mMKM seems to be a good candidate for clinical biological calculations in carbon ion therapy for prostate cancer. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Let me read through the abstract carefully and see what it's about. The title mentions understanding Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) and clinical outcomes using particle irradiation, specifically looking at tumor control probability with a modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM). The purpose is to evaluate whether the current RBE models used in Europe for carbon ion therapy are still valid or if they should be updated. They present a new framework for treatment planning and TCP prediction based on mMKM. Methods include recalculating treatment plans for 91 patients, comparing proton and carbon ion therapies, deriving parameters from photon-irradiated patient data, and generating new optimized plans. The results show significant biological dose deviations between protons and carbon ions, with different GyRBEmMKM per fraction and TCP predictions that match clinical outcomes. They also extended the model to helium ion therapy, showing improved sparing of rectum and bladder compared to protons. Conclusions validate the mMKM model against clinical data for both proton and carbon ion therapies and suggest it's a good candidate for biological calculations in carbon ion therapy for prostate cancer. Now, considering the topic is about AI methods in carbon ion therapy, I need to assess if this article discusses any AI applications. The abstract talks about a modified microdosimetric kinetic model used for treatment planning and TCP prediction. It mentions recalculating plans, deriving parameters from data, and optimizing new plans. However, there's no mention of machine learning, algorithms, or any specific AI techniques being applied here. The focus is more on the biological modeling aspect rather than AI methods. Therefore, while it's relevant to carbon ion therapy and treatment planning, it doesn't specifically address the application of AI methods in this context. So, I think this article shouldn't be included in the literature review focused on AI applications."
rayyan-97865228,Use of parvovirus B19-like particles in self-illuminated photodynamic therapy for solid tumors,"Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer photodynamic therapy, which uses light generated by bioluminescent proteins to activate photosensitizers and produce reactive oxygen species without the need for external irradiation, has shown promising results in cancer models. However, the characterization of delivery systems that can incorporate the components of this therapy for preferential delivery to the tumor remains necessary. In this work, we have characterized parvovirus B19-like particles (B19V-VLPs) as a platform for a photosensitizer and a bioluminescent protein. By chemical and biorthogonal conjugation, we conjugated rose Bengal photosensitizer and firefly luciferase to B19V-VLPs and a protein for added specificity. The results showed that B19V-VLPs can withstand decoration with all three components without affecting its structure or stability. The conjugated luciferase showed activity and was able to activate rose Bengal to produce singlet oxygen without the need for external light. The photodynamic reaction generated by the functionalized VLPs-B19 can decrease the viability of tumor cells in vitro and affect tumor growth and metastasis in the 4 T1 model. Treatment with functionalized VLPs-B19 also increased the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cell populations in the spleen and in inguinal lymph nodes compared to vehicle-treated mice. Our results support B19V-VLPs as a delivery platform for bioluminescent photodynamic therapy components to solid tumors.",0,The abstract discusses photodynamic therapy using viral particles and does not mention AI methods or carbon ion therapy.,"Okay, so I need to determine whether this article is relevant to the topic of applications of AI methods in carbon ion therapy. The abstract provided talks about using parvovirus B19-like particles in self-illuminated photodynamic therapy for solid tumors. They mention bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and how they're using these particles as a delivery system for photosensitizers and bioluminescent proteins. The study shows that this method can decrease tumor cell viability and affect tumor growth and metastasis, along with some immune response effects. However, I don't see any mention of AI methods or carbon ion therapy in the abstract. Carbon ion therapy is a specific type of radiation therapy, often involving precise targeting using technologies like particle accelerators, which might sometimes use AI for optimization. But this article seems to be about photodynamic therapy delivery mechanisms, not related to AI or carbon ions at all. Therefore, it doesn't seem relevant to the given topic."
